宇宙魔方已经苏醒
The Tesseract has awakened.

18
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,620
它在一个渺小的世界  人类的世界
It is on a little world, a human world.

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,300
人类想要使用它的力量
They would wield its power,

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,270
但只有我们的盟友了解它
but our ally knows its workings

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,270
人类是痴心妄想
as they never will.

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,860
他已经做好准备
He is ready to lead

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,360
率领我们的齐塔瑞大军
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,040
他将成为地球的主宰
A world will be his.

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,090
而你将统治整个宇宙
The universe, yours.

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,180
至于人类  只能乖乖接受毁灭的命运
And the humans, what can they do but burn?

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,410
全体人员注意  撤离命令已确认
All personnel, the evacuation order has been confirmed.

情况有多糟
How bad is it?

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,480
问题就在这里  长官  我们不知道
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,060
塞尔维格博士4小时前检测到
Dr Selvig read an energy surge

32
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,760
宇宙魔方释放出了一股能量涌
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,730
太空总署没有允许塞尔维格进行测试
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,170
他没做测试  他当时根本不在
He wasn't testing it. He wasn't even in the room.

35
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,260
能量是自然触发
Spontaneous event.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,620
它就自行启动了吗
It just turned itself on?

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,900
现在达到什么能量等级了
Where are the energy levels now?

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,460
还在上升  塞尔维格关不掉它
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down,

39
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,450
我们只好下令撤离
we ordered evac.

40
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,520
全员撤离还要多久
How long to get everyone out?

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,370
园区应能在半小时内清空
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.

42
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,310
再快点
Do better.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,760
长官  撤离可能也没有用
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,300
那我们该让大家回去睡觉吗
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

45
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,570
如果我们无法控制宇宙魔方的能量
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

46
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,120
危害波及范围或许会超出我们的想象
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,010
我要你去确认转移
I need you to make sure

48
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,100
二阶的所有原型机
the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,390
长官  现在真的还要顾及那个吗
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

50
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,200
只要地球末日还没来临
Until such time as the world ends,

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,690
我们就还要做好充足的准备
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,900
清空地下的所有技术设备
Clear out the tech below.

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,390
把二阶的所有设备装车运走
Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.

54
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,500
是  长官
Yes, sir.

55
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,990
跟我来
With me.

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,630
博士  什么情况
Talk to me, Doctor.

57
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,090
局长
Director.

58
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,650
现在我们有确认的情况吗
Is there anything we know for certain?

59
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,460
宇宙魔方乱动起来了
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

60
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,690
-你在说笑吗  -这一点也不好笑
- Is that supposed to be funny? - No, it's not funny at all.

61
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,570
宇宙魔方不止被激活了  她还  自作主张
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.

62
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,810
你试过切断电源了吧
I assume you pulled the plug.

63
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,740
她自身就是能量源
She's an energy source.

64
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,520
我们关上电源  她能重新启动
We turn off the power, she turns it back on.

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,320
如果她的能量达到峰值
If she reaches peak level...

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,080
我们为此做了准备  博士
We prepared for this, Doctor.

67
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,030
利用来自宇宙的能量
Harnessing energy from space.

68
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,510
我们还没有掌控的能力
But we don't have the harness.

69
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,330
我的计算还远没有完成
My calculations are far from complete.

70
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,870
而现在她在释放干扰和辐射
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.

71
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,310
没什么危害  只是低水平的伽马射线
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.

72
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,270
那是能有危害的
That can be harmful.

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
巴顿特工呢
Where's Agent Barton?

74
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,860
那只鹰吗
The Hawk?

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,840
当然还是窝在巢里了
Up in his nest, as usual.

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,190
巴顿特工  回话
Agent Barton, report.

77
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,200
我让你负责安保
I gave you this detail

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,960
是让你密切关注一切情况
so you could keep a close eye on things.

79
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,880
我在高处看得更清楚
Well, I see better from a distance.

80
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,250
那你看到是什么激活了魔方吗
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?

81
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,170
博士  能量又激增了
Doctor, it's spiking again.

82
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,980
没有人进出
No one's come or gone.

83
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,640
塞尔维格没问题
And Selvig's clean.

84
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,780
没与人接触或传递信息
No contacts, no IMs.

85
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,830
如果有谁在搞鬼  长官
If there was any tampering, sir,

86
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,250
也不是我们这边的人
it wasn't at this end.

87
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,020
什么意思
"At this end"?

88
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,630
魔方是通向宇宙另一端的门吧
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?

89
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,320
而门从两边都能开
Doors open from both sides.

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,080
还没到
Not yet.

91
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,460
先生  请放下你的矛
Sir, please put down the spear.

92
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,890
你挺勇敢[有心]
You have heart.

93
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,390
劝你不要
Please don't.

94
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,020
我还需要它
I still need that.

95
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,720
没必要把事情闹得更大
This doesn't have to get any messier.

96
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,920
当然有必要
Of course it does.

97
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,330
我远道而来就是为了它
I've come too far for anything else.

98
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,490
我是洛基  来自阿斯加德
I am Loki, of Asgard

99
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,060
我肩负着光荣的使命
and I am burdened with glorious purpose.

100
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,130
洛基
Loki,

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,520
托尔的弟弟
brother of Thor.

102
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,130
我们跟你们毫无纠葛
We have no quarrel with your people.

103
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,210
就像蚂蚁也没有招惹靴子
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

104
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,720
你的意思是要踩死我们吗
Are you planning to step on us?

105
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,310
我带来了福音
I come with glad tidings

106
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,230
我要帮你们摆脱束缚
of a world made free.

107
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,540
什么的束缚
Free from what?

108
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,720
自由
Freedom.

109
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,180
自由是人生最大的谎言
Freedom is life's great lie.

110
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,810
如果你能发自内心接受这一点
Once you accept that, in your heart,

111
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,900
那你就能获得安宁
you will know peace.

112
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,160
你口口声声说安宁
Yeah, you say "Peace,"

113
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,980
但我觉得你的意思正相反
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

114
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,150
长官  弗瑞局长在拖延时间
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

115
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,440
这个地方就要爆炸了
This place is about to blow

116
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,460
我们会被压在几十米的石头下
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

117
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,470
他想要埋葬我们
He means to bury us.

118
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,000
就像古时的法老
Like the pharaohs of old.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,240
他说得对  传送门正在自我塌陷
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.

120
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,970
再过两分钟就会达到极值
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.

121
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,030
那好吧
Well, then.

122
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,950
我要用这些车
I need these vehicles.

123
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,950
-那是谁  -不知道
- Who's that? - They didn't tell me.

124
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,850
希尔
Hill!

125
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,000
听得到吗
Do you copy?

126
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,640
巴顿叛变了
Barton has turned.

127
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,500
他们抢走了宇宙魔方  拦住他们
They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!

128
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,920
好了  走吧  别管了  快走
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

129
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,180
楼上撤空了  长官  你得赶快离开
We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go.

130
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,070
局长
Director?

131
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,480
弗瑞局长  听到了吗
Director Fury, do you copy?

132
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,950
宇宙魔方被敌人抢走了
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

133
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,250
有人负伤  希尔你呢
I have men down. Hill?

134
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,370
还有很多人被埋在地下
A lot of men still under.

135
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,800
我不知道有多少幸存者
I don't know how many survivors.

136
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
发出全面命令
Sound a general call.

137
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,850
所有不参与救援的人员
I want every living soul not working rescue

138
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,340
去追查箱子的下落
looking for that briefcase.

139
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,280
明白
Roger that.

140
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,650
科尔森  返回基地  这是7级事件
Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven.

141
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,260
现在
As of right now,

142
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,230
战争已经打响
we are at war.

143
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,740
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

144
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:49,980
{\an5}复仇者联盟

145
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,280
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}今晚和我想的不太一样

146
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,500
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我知道你是怎么想的

147
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,760
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}相信我

148
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,080
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}这样更好

149
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,980
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你为谁卖命

150
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,890
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}是勒曼托夫吗

151
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,450
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}他觉得

152
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,690
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我们还需要经过他同意

153
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,460
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}才能运我们的货吗

154
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,330
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}不是索罗霍布将军负责出口生意吗

155
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,790
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}索罗霍布

156
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,010
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}他就是个中间人  幌子

157
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,420
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你那过时的情报害了你

158
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,910
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}赫赫有名的黑寡妇

159
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,020
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}也不过是个花瓶而已

160
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,420
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你真的觉得我漂亮吗

161
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:13,510
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}告诉勒曼托夫  不劳他运坦克了

162
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,880
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}告诉他  他玩完了

163
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,690
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}不过

164
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
你可能得写下来了
...you may have to write it down.

165
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,730
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}找她的

166
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,460
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你给我听好了

167
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,630
你在114号索伦斯基广场三楼
You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

168
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,270
我们的F22战斗机距你只有8英里
We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

169
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,630
让那女人接电话  否则不等你跑到大厅
Put the woman on the phone, or I will blow up the block

170
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,480
我就能炸平整条街
before you can make the lobby.

171
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,910
-你得回来  -你开玩笑吗  我在工作
- We need you to come in. - Are you kidding? I'm working.

172
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,260
这事更紧急
This takes precedence.

173
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,780
我正在进行审讯
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

174
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,160
而这个傻逼什么都说了
This moron is giving me everything.

175
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,200
我没什么都说啊
I don't give everything.

176
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,060
听着  我现在脱不开身
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.

177
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,050
娜塔莎
Natasha...

178
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,030
巴顿被策反了
Barton's been compromised.

179
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,590
你先别挂
Let me put you on hold.

180
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,990
巴顿现在在哪里
Where is Barton now?

181
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,600
-不知道  -他还活着吧
- We don't know. - But he's alive?

182
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,580
应该是的  等你回来再细说
We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.

183
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,830
但你得先去找大家伙谈谈
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

184
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,810
科尔森  你也知道斯塔克
Coulson, you know that Stark

185
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,180
并不怎么信任我
trusts me about as far as he can throw me.

186
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,690
斯塔克交给我  你去找那个"大家伙"
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

187
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,480
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你是谁

188
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,780
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}快出去

189
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,580
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}这里有病人

190
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,340
你是医生
You're a doctor.

191
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,530
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我爸爸昏迷不醒

192
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,660
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}他发烧了  还一直难受地呻吟

193
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,960
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}但眼睛却睁不开

194
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,070
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}慢慢说

195
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,740
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我爸爸

196
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,080
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}像他们一样吗

197
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,160
求你了
Please.

198
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,930
该先收钱的  班纳
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

199
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,720
对于一个该远离压力的人来说
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress

200
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,230
你可真是选了一个好地方安居
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

201
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,090
远离压力不是我的诀窍
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

202
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,360
那是什么  做瑜伽吗
Then what is it? Yoga?

203
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,490
你把我引到郊区来  真聪明
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.

204
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,890
这里肯定被包围了吧
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

205
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,480
只有你和我
Just you and me.

206
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,690
你那个小演员呢
And your actress buddy?

207
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,290
她也是间谍吗  入行还真早啊
Is she a spy, too? They start that young?

208
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,440
我当年就是
I did.

209
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,080
你是谁
Who are you?

210
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,600
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫
Natasha Romanoff.

211
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,190
你是来杀我的吗  罗曼诺夫女士
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

212
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,630
因为那对所有人都不会有好结果的
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.

213
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,800
不  当然不是  我是代表神盾局而来
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

214
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,510
神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

215
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,780
他们怎么找到我的
How did they find me?

216
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,090
我们一直掌握着你的行踪  博士
We never lost you, Doctor.

217
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,690
只是一直保持着距离
We've kept our distance.

218
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,800
甚至还替你甩掉了一些其他相关方
Even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.

219
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,520
为什么
Why?

220
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,460
尼克·弗瑞还挺信任你
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

221
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,490
但现在你得跟我走
But now we need you to come in.

222
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,150
要是我不肯呢
What if I say no?

223
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,280
我会说服你
I'll persuade you.

224
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,760
要是...那个家伙不肯呢
And what if the other guy says no?

225
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,660
你一年多没出过"事故"了
You've been more than a year without an incident.

226
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,860
我想你应该也不想破这个戒
I don't think you want to break that streak.

227
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,950
我并不是总能如愿的
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

228
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,080
博士  我们可能要迎来一场全球灾难
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

229
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,780
那是我一直在努力避免的
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

230
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,850
这个
This

231
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,660
是宇宙魔方
is the Tesseract.

232
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,080
它有毁灭整个地球的能量
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

233
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,640
那弗瑞想要我做什么  把它吃掉吗
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?

234
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,450
他要你找到它  它被抢走了
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

235
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,790
它发出的伽马信号太弱  我们无法追踪
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.

236
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,360
而你是最了解伽马射线的人了
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.

237
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,150
否则我也不会来找你
If there was, that's where I'd be.

238
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,170
所以  弗瑞不是派你来抓怪物的咯
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

239
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,690
反正他不是这么跟我说的
Not that he's told me.

240
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,340
他什么都会跟你说吗
And he tells you everything?

241
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,170
去跟弗瑞谈吧  他需要你的帮助
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

242
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,190
他要把我关起来吗
He needs me in a cage?

243
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,300
没有人会把你关起...
No one's going to put you in a...

244
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,820
不要再骗我了
Stop lying to me!

245
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,460
抱歉  我不该这么凶
I'm sorry. That was mean.

246
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,010
我就是想试探一下你
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

247
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,640
这样吧  我们好好说话
Why don't we do this the easy way

248
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,180
你把枪收起来
where you don't use that

249
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,240
而我也确保那个家伙不会乱来
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

250
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,840
好吗
Okay?

251
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,300
娜塔莎
Natasha?

252
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,130
退后
Stand down.

253
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,290
一切正常
We're good here.

254
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,800
还说"只有你和我"呢
"Just you and me."

255
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,630
这太过分了  局长
This is out of line, Director.

256
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,540
你在摆弄你控制不了的力量
You're dealing with forces you can't control.

257
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,540
你打过仗吗  理事先生  上过战场吗
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?

258
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,590
你那时觉得能完全掌控局面吗
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

259
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,010
你是说这个阿斯加德已经向地球宣战了吗
You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?

260
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,900
不是阿斯加德  只是洛基
Not Asgard. Loki.

261
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,360
他不可能是单干  另一个神呢
He can't be working alone. What about the other one?

262
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,850
他哥哥
His brother.

263
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,170
根据我们的情报  托尔不是敌人
Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile

264
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,560
但他离我们太远了
but he's worlds away.

265
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,450
我们不能指望他来帮忙
We can't depend on him to help, either.

266
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,390
我们只能靠自己
It's up to us.

267
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,320
所以你更应该全力开发二阶
Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.

268
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,580
它正是为这种情况...
It was designed for exactly this...

269
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,240
二阶还没完成  但敌人却准备好了
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

270
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,970
我们需要一支应急小队
We need a response team.

271
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,430
复仇者计划已被取消
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

272
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,190
我不是指复仇者联盟
This isn't about the Avengers.

273
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,360
我们看过那份名单
We've seen the list.

274
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,950
你有着世界一流的秘密特工组织
You're running the world's greatest covert security network

275
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,810
却要把人类的命运交给
and you're going to leave the fate of the human race

276
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,200
一群怪胎吗
to a handful of freaks.

277
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,380
我没有要把任何事交给任何人
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

278
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,880
我们确实需要一支应急小队
We need a response team.

279
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,800
这些人或许孤僻  甚至不太正常
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even

280
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,720
但我相信只要有正确的动力
but I believe with the right push

281
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,380
他们就能成为我们需要的力量
they can be exactly what we need.

282
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,880
你相信吗
You believe?

283
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,210
靠感情可赢不了战争  局长
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

284
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,410
是的  只能靠战士
No, it's won by soldiers.

285
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,200
没时间了
There's not enough time.

286
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,720
我得让飞机坠海
I got to put her in the water!

287
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,270
你不是一个人
You won't be alone.

288
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,640
天啊
Oh, my God.

289
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,120
这家伙还活着
This guy is still alive!

290
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,670
睡不着吗
Trouble sleeping?

291
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,530
我睡了70年  长官  我想我睡得够久了
I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill.

292
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,200
那你该出去走走
Then you should be out,

293
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,000
庆祝一下  看看世界
celebrating, seeing the world.

294
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,200
我沉睡的时候  世界还在打仗
When I went under, the world was at war.

295
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,410
等我醒来  他们说战争打赢了
I wake up, they say we won.

296
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,860
却没说我们失去了什么
They didn't say what we lost.

297
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,580
我们一路走来犯了些错误
We've made some mistakes along the way.

298
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,080
有些就在不久之前
Some, very recently.

299
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,410
你有任务要给我吗  长官
Are you here with a mission, sir?

300
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,490
是的
I am.

301
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,290
想让我回归这个世界吗
Trying to get me back in the world?

302
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,250
是让你拯救世界
Trying to save it.

303
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,700
九头蛇的秘密武器
HYDRA's secret weapon.

304
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,060
{\an8}宇宙魔方

305
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,430
是霍华德·斯塔克在找你的时候
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean

306
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,300
从海底打捞上来的
when he was looking for you.

307
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,180
他和我们想的一样
He thought what we think.

308
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,800
宇宙魔方是开发无限可再生能源的关键
The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.

309
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,930
这正是世界所迫切需要的
That's something the world sorely needs.

310
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,450
它被谁抢走了
Who took it from you?

311
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,870
他叫洛基
He's called Loki.

312
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,630
他不是本地人
He's not from around here.

313
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,430
你加入的话还有很多情况需要了解
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.

314
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,890
这世界和你记忆中的比起来
The world has gotten even stranger

315
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,260
变得更加奇怪了
than you already know.

316
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,450
事到如今  我觉得已经没什么能让我意外了
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.

317
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,330
我赌10块钱  说你错了
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

318
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,290
任务资料
There's a debriefing packet

319
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,410
已经放在你公寓了
waiting for you back at your apartment.

320
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,870
关于宇宙魔方
Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract

321
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,760
你能告诉我们什么吗
that we ought to know now?

322
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
你们就不该把它捞上来
You should have left it in the ocean.

323
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,790
这边准备就绪  接下来看你的了
Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.

324
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,290
你断开输电线了吗
You disconnected the transmission lines?

325
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,400
我们与电网断开了吗
Are we off the grid?

326
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,160
斯塔克大厦即将成为
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon

327
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,370
自给清洁能源的灯塔
of self-sustaining clean energy.

328
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,310
如果方舟反应堆能接替发电
Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over

329
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,940
并且正常运行的话
and it actually works.

330
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,050
应该没问题
I assume.

331
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,810
开灯吧
Light her up.

332
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,750
{\an8}斯塔克

333
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,510
看起来怎么样
How does it look?

334
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,440
像圣诞彩灯  但更有我的风格
Like Christmas, but with more me.

335
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,280
我们得加大公众宣传
We've got to go wider on the public awareness campaign.

336
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,070
你得在媒体上造势
You need to do some press.

337
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,880
我明天去华盛顿
I'm in DC tomorrow,

338
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,690
为另外三座大楼选址
I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.

339
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,300
派珀  你把气氛都毁了  当下
Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?

340
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,550
要享受当下
Enjoy the moment.

341
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,250
等你进来我再享受
Get in here and I will.

342
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,520
先生  神盾局的科尔森特工打来电话
Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.

343
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,470
说我在外面
I'm not in.

344
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,530
我确实在外面
I'm actually out.

345
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,040
先生  恐怕他坚持要找您
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

346
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,250
强硬点  贾维斯  我有约会
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

347
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,000
能量水平稳定...吧
Levels are holding steady, I think.

348
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,420
当然了  是我亲自动手的
Of course they are. I was directly involved.

349
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,610
这正好让我想到一个问题
Which brings me to my next question.

350
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,870
当天才的感觉如何
How does it feel to be a genius?

351
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,430
我怎么会知道
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

352
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,510
这叫什么话  这一切都归功于你
What do you mean? All this came from you.

353
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,290
不  这一切都归功于这个
No, all this came from that.

354
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,340
别这么谦虚  拜托
Give yourself some credit. Please.

355
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,350
斯塔克大厦就是你的孩子
Stark Tower is your baby.

356
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,320
你有12%的功劳
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

357
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,510
才12%
12%?

358
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,800
商量一下可以升到15%
An argument can be made for 15.

359
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,630
我的孩子我只有12%的份
12%? My baby?

360
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,230
毕竟重活都是我干的
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

361
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,510
都不是比喻  重物都是我搬的
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

362
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,000
而且  不好意思  安全漏洞怎么算
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

363
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
该算在你头上
That was on you.

364
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,310
-我的私人电梯  -你是说我们的电梯吧
- My private elevator... - You mean our elevator?

365
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,110
挤满了一身臭汗的工人
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

366
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,160
过会儿你会因为我说了占多少份这话
I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages

367
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,200
而温柔地报复我  是吧
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

368
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,110
没你想的那么温柔
It's not going to be that subtle.

369
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,200
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

370
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,070
我在下一栋大楼上写上你的名字
The next building is gonna say "Potts" on the tower.

371
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,670
直接写在地契上吧
On the lease.

372
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,130
打电话问问你妈  你能留下过夜吗
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

373
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,300
先生  您的电话
Sir, the telephone.

374
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,640
恐怕我的程序被人改写了
I'm afraid my protocols are being overridden.

375
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,390
斯塔克  我们得谈谈
Mr Stark, we need to talk.

376
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,840
这里是托尼·斯塔克的生化机器人替身
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.

377
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,860
-有事请留言  -是急事
- Please leave a message. - This is urgent.

378
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,210
那就说得急一点
Then leave it urgently.

379
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,680
安全漏洞  你的错
Security breach. It's on you.

380
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,440
-斯塔克先生  -菲尔  快进来
- Mr Stark. - Phil! Come in.

381
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,380
菲尔
"Phil"?

382
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,490
我不能久留
I can't stay.

383
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,300
他的名字不是"特工"吗
His first name is "Agent."

384
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,810
进来吧  我们在庆祝
Come on in. We're celebrating.

385
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,550
所以他不能久留
Which is why he can't stay.

386
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,240
你得尽快看完这些资料
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.

387
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,320
我不喜欢别人递我东西
I don't like being handed things.

388
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,010
没事  我就喜欢别人递我东西
That's fine, because I love to be handed things.

389
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,620
我们换换吧
So, let's trade.

390
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,120
谢谢
Thank you.

391
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,800
我的正式咨询时间为每隔一周的周四8点到5点
Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.

392
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,940
这不是咨询
This isn't a consultation.

393
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,740
是关于复仇者联盟吗
Is this about the Avengers?

394
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,910
我对那个一无所知
Which I know nothing about.

395
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,630
复仇者计划不是被弃了吗
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

396
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,460
再说我都不够格
And I didn't even qualify.

397
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,310
这我也不知情
I didn't know that either.

398
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,700
显然人家嫌我不稳定  自我为中心
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

399
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,090
没有团队精神
don't play well with others.

400
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,920
这我倒是知道
That I did know.

401
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,910
我们现在顾不上性格问题了
This isn't about personality profiles any more.

402
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,490
随便了  波茨小姐  能过来一下吗
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

403
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,680
稍等
Half a mo.

404
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,360
我以为我们能浪漫一会呢
You know, I thought we were having a moment.

405
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,510
我只能享受12%的浪漫
I was having 12% of a moment.

406
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,820
情况好像很严重  菲尔看上去挺紧张
This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.

407
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,910
你怎么知道  你干嘛叫他菲尔
How would you know if it's... Why is he "Phil"?

408
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,930
这都是什么
What is all this?

409
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,990
这是
This is

410
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,030
自己看吧
this.

411
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,520
我今晚就飞去华盛顿
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

412
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,710
-明天吧  -你有功课要做  很多功课
- Tomorrow. - You have homework. You have a lot of homework.

413
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,520
要是我没有呢
Well, what if I didn't?

414
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,660
-没有  -是啊
- If you didn't? - Yeah.

415
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,430
你是说等你做完了吗
You mean when you've finished?

416
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,100
那样的话
Well, then...

417
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,040
说定了  旅途顺利
Square deal. Fly safe.

418
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,990
好好用功
Work hard.

419
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,720
你会路过拉瓜地亚机场吗
So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?

420
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,340
-我捎你一程吧  -太好了
- I can drop you. - Fantastic.

421
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,610
那个大提琴手怎么样了
I want to hear about the cellist.

422
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,690
你们还在约会吗
Is that still a thing?

423
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,960
她回波特兰了
She moved back to Portland.

424
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,040
怎么会
What?

425
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,450
我们离总部还有约40分钟航程  长官
We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.

426
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,230
班纳博士企图复制我所注射的血清吗
So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?

427
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,480
很多人都试过
A lot of people were.

428
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,770
你是世上第一个超级英雄
You were the world's first superhero.

429
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,120
班纳以为伽马射线可能是破解
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key

430
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,570
厄斯金原始配方的关键
to unlocking Erskine's original formula.

431
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,320
可惜结果不怎么好  是吧
Didn't really go his way, did it?

432
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,370
是啊
Not so much.

433
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,930
不过他正常的时候
When he's not that thing, though,

434
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,020
他简直就像史蒂芬·霍金
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

435
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,320
他是个聪明绝顶的人
He's like a smart person.

436
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,470
我必须要说
I gotta say,

437
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,740
我很荣幸能正式见到你
it's an honour to meet you officially.

438
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,890
我之前其实算是见过你
I've sort of met you. I mean,

439
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,870
你沉睡时我去看过你
I watched you while you were sleeping.

440
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,180
我是说  我们发现
I mean, I was present

441
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,470
被冰冻昏迷不醒的你时  我也在场
while you were unconscious from the ice.

442
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,530
说真的  你能加入我们
You know, it's really just a huge honour

443
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,520
真是莫大的荣幸
to have you on board this...

444
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,260
希望我能胜任
I hope I'm the man for the job.

445
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,570
你肯定能  毫无疑问
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

446
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,920
我们对你的制服做了些修改
We made some modifications to the uniform.

447
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,250
我还提了点设计意见
I had a little design input.

448
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,550
我的制服
The uniform?

449
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,310
星条的样式不会...
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

450
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,390
太过时了吗
old-fashioned?

451
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,800
考虑到眼下的局势
With everything that's happening

452
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,690
和即将到来的恶战
and the things that are about to come to light,

453
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,430
人们或许正需要点过去的精神
people might just need a little old-fashioned.

454
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,420
齐塔瑞人越来越耐不住了
The Chitauri grow restless.

455
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,340
叫他们控制好自己
Let them gird themselves.

456
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,370
我会率领他们发动一场光辉的战役
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

457
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,450
战役
Battle?

458
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,660
捏死地球上的虫子也叫战役吗
Against the meagre might of Earth?

459
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,000
光辉而轻松的战役
Glorious, not lengthy.

460
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,740
前提是你的大军真如你说的那样所向披靡
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

461
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,660
你竟敢质疑我们
You question us?

462
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,050
质疑他
You question him,

463
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,210
别忘了是他把权杖交给了你
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

464
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,390
传授你远古的真知  给予你新的使命
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose

465
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,580
在你被流放和挫败的时候
when you were cast out, defeated?

466
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,830
我曾是王
I was a king!

467
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,410
阿斯加德的合法国王
The rightful king of Asgard,

468
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,460
却被背叛
betrayed.

469
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,650
你的志向  渺小
Your ambition is little

470
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,320
而幼稚
and born of childish need.

471
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,050
我们要的不止是地球
We look beyond the Earth

472
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,450
宇宙魔方会开启更广博的世界
to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

473
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,630
宇宙魔方还在我这里呢
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

474
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,930
我没有威胁你的意思
I don't threaten.

475
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,290
但只要传送门尚未打开
But until I open the doors,

476
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,160
你的军队还非由我统领
until your force is mine to command,

477
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,280
你也只是空谈
you are but words.

478
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,010
你去发动战争吧  阿斯加德人
You will have your war, Asgardian.

479
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,280
可如果你失败了
If you fail,

480
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,180
如果宇宙魔方落入他人之手
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

481
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,110
无论你躲到什么地方
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

482
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,320
我们也会把你找出来
no crevice where he cannot find you.

483
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,590
你自以为了解痛苦的滋味吗
You think you know pain?

484
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,170
他能让你
He will make you long

485
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,290
渴求痛苦的甜蜜
for something sweet as pain.

486
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,570
-去拿队长的装备  -是  长官
- Stow the captain's gear. - Yes, sir.

487
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,070
罗曼诺夫特工  这位是罗杰斯队长
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

488
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,050
女士
Ma'am.

489
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,330
舰桥那边找你
They need you on the bridge.

490
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,330
他们开始面部识别追踪了
They're starting the face-trace.

491
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,310
待会儿见
See you there.

492
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,740
在冰层中找到你的事引起了不小的轰动
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.

493
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,550
我还以为科尔森会开心得晕过去
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

494
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,480
他求你给他的美国队长收藏卡签名了吗
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

495
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,630
收藏卡
Trading cards?

496
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,190
绝版珍藏  他很引以为傲
They're vintage. He's very proud.

497
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,820
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

498
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,190
你好
Yeah, hi.

499
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,360
我听说你要来
They told me you would be coming.

500
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,970
我听说你能找到魔方
Word is, you can find the Cube.

501
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,850
你没听说别的事吗
Is that the only word on me?

502
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,390
我只在意这个
Only word I care about.

503
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,350
你一定觉得这一切很奇怪吧
It must be strange for you, all of this.

504
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,760
老实说  我还觉得挺熟悉的
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

505
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,680
先生们  你们还是快进去吧
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.

506
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,990
这里过会儿就难以呼吸了
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

507
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,430
空勤人员  清空甲板
Flight crew, secure the deck.

508
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,060
这是潜艇吗
Is this a submarine?

509
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,080
是吗
Really?

510
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,320
他们要我待在水下密闭加压的金属罐里吗
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?

511
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,060
不  这个更糟
No, no, this is much worse.

512
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,190
盘旋动力检查完毕  位置稳定
Hover power check complete. Position cyclic.

513
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,950
动力增大至8%
Increase collective to 8.0%.

514
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,130
准备全速起航
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.

515
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,810
将输出升到最高
Increase output to capacity.

516
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,270
全速模式
Power plant performing at capacity.

517
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,850
准备就绪
We are clear.

518
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,550
引擎全部开启
All engines operating.

519
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,890
执行神盾局193.6号紧急协议
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

520
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,600
-已达预定高度  长官  -很好
- We are at level, sir. - Good.

521
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,710
我们消失吧
Let's vanish.

522
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,920
开启反光板
Engage retro-reflection panels.

523
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,550
反光板已开启
Reflection panels engaged.

524
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,580
先生们
Gentlemen.

525
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,720
博士  谢谢你能来
Doctor, thank you for coming.

526
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,380
谢谢你们礼貌地邀请我
Thanks for asking nicely.

527
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,280
我要在这里待上多久
So, how long am I staying?

528
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,310
我们一拿到宇宙魔方
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

529
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,470
就会让你走
you're in the wind.

530
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,840
你们进展如何
Where are you with that?

531
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,330
我们扫描了全球所有
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible

532
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,000
可无线读取的摄像头
camera on the planet.

533
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,370
手机  笔记本
Cell phones, laptops...

534
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,720
只要连接了卫星  就是我们的眼线
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

535
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,180
就这么找还是来不及
That's still not gonna find them in time.

536
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,500
你们得缩小范围
You have to narrow your field.

537
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,700
你能调用多少台光谱仪
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

538
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,380
要多少有多少
How many are there?

539
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,620
联系所有你能找到的实验室
Call every lab you know.

540
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,200
让他们把光谱仪放在房顶
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof

541
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,140
校准搜索伽马射线
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

542
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,570
我会根据聚类识别草拟出追踪算法
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.

543
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,960
至少能排除几个区域
At least we could rule out a few places.

544
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,350
能给我找个工作的地方吗
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

545
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,430
罗曼诺夫特工
Agent Romanoff,

546
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,770
你能带班纳博士去他的实验室吗
could you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please?

547
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,480
你准满意  博士  那里一应俱全
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

548
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,120
放去那边
Put it over there.

549
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,840
你从哪里找来的这些人
Where did you find all these people?

550
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,570
神盾局的敌人到处都是  博士
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.

551
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,560
{\an8}铱  海因里希·赛弗博士

552
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,820
你要的是这个吗
Is this the stuff you need?

553
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,760
对  铱
Yeah, iridium.

554
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,730
陨石里的物质  能形成反质子
It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.

555
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,590
这东西很难找
It's very hard to get hold of.

556
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,370
要是神盾局知道你需要它就更难找了
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

557
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,570
我可不知道
Well, I didn't know.

558
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,080
宇宙魔方让我看到了太多
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

559
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,300
这些超越了知识  而是真理
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

560
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,240
我知道
I know.

561
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,690
它让你看到了什么  巴顿特工
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

562
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,310
我的下个目标
My next target.

563
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,710
告诉我你需要什么
Tell me what you need.

564
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,250
一场声东击西
I need a distraction.

565
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,640
和一个眼球
And an eyeball.

566
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,470
那个...太麻烦就算了
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

567
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,960
哪里  不麻烦
No, no. It's fine.

568
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,930
那是绝版套装
It's a vintage set.

569
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,600
我花了几年才集齐
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.

570
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,630
还很新呢
Near mint.

571
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,200
边角有点泛黄  但...
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

572
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,030
有发现  面部特征67%匹配
We got a hit. A 67% match.

573
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,580
等等  交叉比对显示79%匹配
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

574
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,050
在哪
Location?

575
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:15,400
德国斯图加特  库宁大街28号
Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.

576
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,710
他没有躲起来的意思
He's not exactly hiding.

577
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,790
队长
Captain,

578
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,530
该你上场了
you're up.

579
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,450
{\an5}{\pos(138.4,63.466)}视网膜扫描-身份识别

{\an5}{\pos(173.6,120)}认证

{\an5}{\pos(175,179)}开锁

583
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,260
给我跪下
Kneel before me.

584
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,680
我说了
I said

585
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,890
跪下
kneel!

586
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,120
这样不是更简单吗
Is not this simpler?

587
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,000
这难道不是你们的本性吗
Is this not your natural state?

588
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,420
这是人类心照不宣的本性
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

589
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,470
你们渴望被征服
that you crave subjugation.

590
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,120
自由的光鲜诱惑
The bright lure of freedom

591
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,070
削减了你们人生的乐趣  让你们发狂地追逐权力
diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power,

592
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,930
追逐个性
for identity.

593
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:47,050
你们天生就该被统治
You were made to be ruled.

594
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,540
到头来
In the end,

595
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,950
你们总会俯首称臣
you will always kneel.

596
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,800
不会向你这样的人
Not to men like you.

597
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,870
从没有像我这样的人
There are no men like me.

598
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,580
总是有像你这样的人
There are always men like you.

599
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,620
瞧瞧这个老头  各位
Look to your elder, people.

600
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,850
我就用他  杀一儆百
Let him be an example.

601
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,650
我上次来德国的时候
You know, the last time I was in Germany,

602
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,890
也遇到一个自以为高高在上的人
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

603
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,130
我们也有点意见不合
we ended up disagreeing.

604
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,600
美国大兵
The soldier.

605
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,610
过时的人
The man out of time.

606
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,640
快要玩完的人可不是我
I'm not the one who's out of time.

607
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,750
洛基  放下武器  马上投降
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

608
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,570
跪下
Kneel.

609
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,450
休想
Not today!

610
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,380
到处都是他的分身
The guy's all over the place.

611
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,100
罗曼诺夫特工  想我了吗
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

612
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,340
{\an8}广播系统被改写

613
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,720
出招啊  小鹿斑比
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

614
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,660
这才乖
Good move.

615
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,790
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

616
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,630
队长
Captain.

617
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,350
他开口了吗
Is he saying anything?

618
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,010
什么都没说
Not a word.

619
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,780
带回来再说  我们没时间了
Just get him here. We're low on time.

620
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,820
我有不好的预感
I don't like it.

621
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,710
怎么  因为摇滚明星就这么轻易投降了吗
What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

622
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,840
我可不觉得有多轻易
I don't remember it being that easy.

623
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,490
这家伙战斗力很强
This guy packs a wallop.

624
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,600
不管怎样  你一把年纪  身手还算敏捷
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.

625
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,960
你做什么锻炼  普拉提吗
What's your thing, Pilates?

626
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,850
什么
What?

627
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,020
就跟健美操差不多  
It's like calisthenics.

628
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,420
你或许是错过了不少事
You might have missed a couple of things

629
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,170
毕竟做了那么久的美队冰棒
doing time as a Capsicle.

630
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,720
弗瑞没告诉我他也找你了
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

631
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,130
是啊  弗瑞还有很多事没告诉你
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

632
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,340
哪来的闪电
Where's this coming from?

633
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,170
怎么了  你连闪电都怕吗
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?

634
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,210
我是不喜欢跟随闪电而来的家伙
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

635
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,750
你要干什么
What are you doing?

636
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,320
又来个添乱的
And now there's that guy.

637
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,890
他也是阿斯加德人吗
Another Asgardian?

638
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,280
-你觉得他是友军吗  -无所谓
- That guy's a friendly? - Doesn't matter.

639
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,860
不管他要放了洛基还是杀了他
If he frees Loki or kills him,

640
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,270
宇宙魔方都找不回来了
the Tesseract's lost.

641
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,410
斯塔克  我们需要出击计划
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

642
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,780
我有个计划  出击
I have a plan. Attack.

643
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,360
我劝你别搅这浑水  队长
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

644
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,760
这我做不到
I don't see how I can.

645
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,960
他们是传说人物  基本上就是神
These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.

646
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,540
神只有上帝一个  女士
There's only one God, ma'am.

647
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,600
而且他肯定不会穿成那样
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

648
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,770
宇宙魔方在哪
Where is the Tesseract?

649
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,390
我也想你  哥哥
I missed you, too.

650
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,590
我像是有心情陪你胡闹吗
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

651
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,190
你应该谢谢我
You should thank me.

652
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:05,800
没有了彩虹桥
With the Bifrost gone,

653
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,240
奥丁是聚集了多少黑暗能量
how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster

654
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,750
才把你传送过来
to conjure you here

655
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,500
到你心爱的地球
to your precious Earth?

656
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,660
我以为你死了
I thought you dead.

657
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,110
你为我哀悼了吗
Did you mourn?

658
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,220
我们都哀悼了  我们的父王
We all did. Our father...

659
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,840
是你的父王
Your father.

660
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,470
他把我的身世告诉你了吧
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

661
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,300
我们从小一起长大
We were raised together.

662
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,450
一起玩耍  一起战斗
We played together, we fought together.

663
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,400
你都不记得了吗
Do you remember none of that?

664
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,880
我只记得阴影
I remember a shadow.

665
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,490
我一直笼罩在你伟大的阴影之下
Living in the shade of your greatness.

666
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,500
我只记得你将我推下深渊
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

667
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,490
我本来是王  也本该是王
I, who was, and should be, king!

668
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,670
所以你自认为受了轻视  为了报复我
So you take the world I love as a recompense

669
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,850
就破坏我所爱的世界吗
for your imagined slights?

670
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,150
休想  我会保护地球  洛基
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

671
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,260
那你可保护得真好
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.

672
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,290
人类彼此之间互相残杀
The humans slaughter each other in droves

673
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,370
你却袖手旁观
while you idly fret.

674
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,520
我想要统治他们  这有什么不对
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?

675
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,590
你自以为高他们一等吗
You think yourself above them?

676
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,430
当然
Well, yes.

677
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,140
那你就误解了统治的真谛  弟弟
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

678
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,730
你不适合做王
A throne would suit you ill.

679
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,960
我见识到了你根本不知道的世界
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

680
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:31,540
在流放期间  奥丁森  我开了眼界
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

681
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,410
我见识到了宇宙魔方的真正力量
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,

682
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,460
等我用它...
and when I wield it...

683
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,060
是谁向你展示了它的力量
Who showed you this power?

684
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,710
你这自封之王听命于谁
Who controls the would-be king?

685
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,920
-我就是王  -在这里不是
- I am a king! - Not here!

686
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,040
你交出宇宙魔方
You give up the Tesseract!

687
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,260
放弃这恶毒的野心
You give up this poisonous dream!

688
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,820
你跟我回家
You come home.

689
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,170
魔方不在我手上
I don't have it.

690
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,040
没有魔方你就不能带我回家
You need the Cube to bring me home.

691
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,350
但我把它转移了  我也不知道它在哪里
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

692
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,140
你给我听好  弟弟
You listen well, brother.

693
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,290
我听着呢
I'm listening.

694
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,460
再动我就要你好看
Do not touch me again.

695
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,300
那你也别动我的东西
Then don't take my stuff.

696
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,950
你根本不知道自己面对的是什么
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

697
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,710
莎翁戏剧的公园公演吗
Shakespeare in the Park?

698
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:31,180
尔取帘为披风  汝母可知
Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?

699
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,150
这超出了你的能力范围  铁皮人
This is beyond you, metal man.

700
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,470
洛基会受到阿斯加德的制裁
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

701
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,510
只要他交出魔方  他就随你处置  否则
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,

702
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,260
你少碍事
stay out of the way.

703
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,040
外地人
Tourist.

704
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,980
好吧
Okay.

705
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:24,060
能量达到400%
Power at 400% capacity.

706
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,170
这倒是不赖
How about that?

707
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:30,630
够了
That's enough.

708
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,270
我不知道你想做什么
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

709
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,800
我是来终结洛基的阴谋
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.

710
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,750
那就拿出行动来  把锤子放下
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

711
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,710
哦不
Yeah... No.

712
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,750
坏主意  他爱死那锤子了
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

713
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,070
你要我放下锤子吗
You want me to put the hammer down?

714
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,870
闹够了吗
Are we done, here?

715
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,340
我先把话说清楚
In case it's unclear,

716
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,420
你要是试图逃跑
if you try to escape,

717
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,310
你就算是刮了一下玻璃
if you so much as scratch that glass,

718
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:28,200
这个牢笼就会从三万英尺的高空坠落
it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.

719
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,810
你明白了吗
You get how that works?

720
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,970
现在谁是蚂蚁  谁是靴子
Ant, boot.

721
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,250
这个笼子真不赖
It's an impressive cage.

722
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,180
我猜不是为我造的吧
Not built, I think, for me.

723
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,460
是为比你厉害得多的东西建的
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

724
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,970
我听说了
Oh, I've heard.

725
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,010
一头毫无心智的野兽
A mindless beast.

726
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,560
却装作自己仍是常人
Makes play he's still a man.

727
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,900
你是有多绝望
How desperate are you,

728
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,170
找来这种无法控制的怪物保护你们
that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?

729
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,010
我有多绝望
How desperate am I?

730
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,530
你威胁要向我的世界开战
You threaten my world with war.

731
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,970
你偷走了自己无法掌控的力量
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

732
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,510
你说着和平  却以杀戮为乐
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.

733
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,270
你确实逼得我很绝望
You have made me very desperate.

734
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,390
你或许会因此而后悔
You might not be glad that you did.

735
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,420
失去快到手的东西让你很生气吧
It burns you to have come so close.

736
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,150
得到宇宙魔方  掌握它的力量
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

737
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,510
无限的能量
unlimited power.

738
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,330
用来做什么
And for what?

739
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,220
为全人类点亮一盏明灯
A warm light for all mankind to share.

740
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,910
之后却又见识到了真正的力量
And then to be reminded what real power is.

741
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:49,190
"真正力量"要是想看杂志了就吱一声
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.

742
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,360
他还真是惹人喜欢
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

743
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,400
洛基是在拖延时间
Loki's gonna drag this out.

744
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,170
托尔  他到底有什么打算
So, Thor, what's his play?

745
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:08,010
他有一支齐塔瑞大军
He has an army called the Chitauri.

746
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,310
他们不是阿斯加德人  而是来自未知世界
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.

747
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,630
他打算率领这支大军攻打你们
He means to lead them against your people.

748
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,400
他们会帮助他夺取地球
They will win him the Earth,

749
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,210
我猜他会用宇宙魔方作为交换
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

750
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,320
大军
An army

751
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,020
还是来自外太空
from outer space.

752
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,960
那他还要建个传送门
So, he's building another portal.

753
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,500
这就是他带走艾瑞克·塞尔维格的目的
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

754
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,490
塞尔维格
Selvig?

755
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,870
-他是个天体物理学家  -他是我朋友
- He's an astrophysicist. - He's a friend.

756
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,240
洛基对他施了法术  控制了他
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

757
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:32,840
还有我们的一个特工
along with one of ours.

758
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,000
洛基为什么会这么轻易投降
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

759
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,110
他在这里可没法指挥大军
He's not leading an army from here.

760
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,040
我觉得我们不该一直关注洛基
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

761
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,080
那家伙的脑回路不正常
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

762
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,380
一看就是个疯子
You could smell crazy on him.

763
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,820
注意你的言辞
Have care how you speak.

764
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,410
即使洛基失去了理智  他还是阿斯加德人
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.

765
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:47,730
还是我弟弟
And he is my brother.

766
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,380
他两天内杀了80个人
He killed 80 people in two days.

767
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,770
他是领养的
He's adopted.

768
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,190
我觉得我们该着重技术问题
I think it's about the mechanics.

769
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,090
铱  他们为什么需要铱
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?

770
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,480
铱可用作稳定剂
It's a stabilising agent.

771
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,710
我就说  挑个周末
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

772
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,450
我飞你去波特兰
I'll fly you to Portland.

773
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,910
爱情要维护的啊
Keep love alive.

774
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,210
它能防止传送门自我塌陷
It means the portal won't collapse on itself

775
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,610
像之前在神盾局基地那样
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

776
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,240
别记仇  惊爆点  你真挺有劲
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.

777
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,370
还能让传送门按洛基的心意
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

778
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,900
想开多大  多久都没问题
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

779
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:18,290
升起后桅  调转顶帆
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

780
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,030
那个人在玩小蜜蜂
That man is playing Galaga.

781
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,690
自以为别人看不到  但我看到了
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

782
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,910
弗瑞怎么能看到两边的屏幕
How does Fury even see these?

783
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:29,890
转身看
He turns.

784
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,180
很累人的样子
Sounds exhausting.

785
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,000
其他原材料
The rest of the raw materials,

786
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,940
巴顿特工都能轻易弄到手
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

787
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,140
他只缺少一个要素  能源
The only major component he still needs is a power source

788
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,250
一种高密度能量
of high-energy density.

789
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,690
来激活魔方
Something to kick-start the Cube.

790
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,970
你什么时候对热核天体物理学这么精通了
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

791
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,430
就昨晚
Last night.

792
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,190
任务资料  塞尔维格的笔记
The packet, Selvig's notes,

793
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,860
萃取论论文
the extraction theory papers.

794
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,940
你们都没做功课吗
Am I the only one who did the reading?

795
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,970
洛基需要什么特定能源吗
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

796
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,780
他得把魔方加热到1.2亿开
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin

797
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,490
才能突破库仑势垒
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

798
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:03,990
除非  塞尔维格已经想出
Unless Selvig has figured out

799
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:06,220
稳定量子隧穿效应的方法
how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect.

800
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,090
如果他想出来了 
Well, if he could do that,

801
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:10,050
就能用任何一个反应堆实现重离子束聚变
he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.

802
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,740
终于有个说人话的了
Finally, someone who speaks English.

803
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,200
是这样吗
Is that what just happened?

804
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,670
幸会  班纳博士
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

805
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,330
你对反电子碰撞的研究真是无与伦比
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

806
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,510
而且我觉得你失去控制
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

807
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,760
变身狂暴巨怪的样子更是赞
and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.

808
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,970
-谢谢  -班纳博士来这里只是为了追踪魔方
- Thanks. - Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.

809
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,400
我希望你能和他一起合作
I was hoping you might join him.

810
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,680
从他的权杖入手吧
I would start with that stick of his.

811
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,430
不管有没有魔力
It may be magical,

812
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,360
它的运作方式很像九头蛇的武器
but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.

813
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,700
这我不了解  但权杖的力量来自魔方
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.

814
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,600
我还想知道
And I would like to know

815
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,300
洛基是怎么用它  把我认识的最机敏的两个人
how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know

816
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,590
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}出自《绿野仙踪》

817
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,590
变成了他自己的飞猴
into his personal flying monkeys.

818
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,290
-什么飞猴  我没懂  -我懂
- Monkeys? I do not understand. - I do.

819
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,150
我知道这个梗
I understood that reference.

820
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,640
我们开工吧  博士
Shall we play, Doctor?

821
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,800
这边走  先生
This way, sir.

822
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,090
伽马读数与塞尔维格对宇宙魔方的报告
The gamma readings are definitely consistent with

823
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,170
完全相符
Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

824
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,200
但处理数据要几周时间
But it's going to take weeks to process.

825
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,480
如果我们绕过他们的主机
If we bypass their mainframe

826
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,850
直接连接主模块
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

827
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:22,300
速度就能达到每秒六百万亿次浮点运算
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

828
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,380
我只带了个牙刷
All I packed was a toothbrush.

829
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,060
你该抽空到斯塔克大厦来
You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.

830
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,560
最高10层都是研究开发部
Top ten floors, all R&D.

831
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,120
你肯定喜欢  简直就是糖果乐园
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

832
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,120
谢了  不过我上次去纽约时
Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,

833
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,730
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《无敌浩克》

834
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,730
把哈莱姆区给砸烂了
I kind of broke Harlem.《无敌浩克》

835
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,710
我保证不给你压力
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

836
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,860
不紧张  也不吓唬你
No tension, no surprises.

837
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:44,790
这么淡定
Nothing?

838
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:45,830
你疯了吗
Are you nuts?

839
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,940
谁知道呢
Jury's out.

840
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,970
你还真能压得住火气  你有什么诀窍
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret?

841
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,900
舒缓爵士乐  邦哥鼓  还是抽一大袋大麻
Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?

842
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,500
你把所有的事都当成笑话吗
Is everything a joke to you?

843
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,400
只有好笑的事
Funny things are.

844
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,820
危及航母上所有人的生命安全并不好笑
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.

845
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,340
-无意冒犯  博士  -没关系
- No offence, Doc. - It's all right,

846
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,940
我要是连这都受不住  也不会来了
I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.

847
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,300
你太小心了  大块头
You're tip-toeing, big man.

848
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,100
你该放开点
You need to strut.

849
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,940
而你该专心解决问题  斯塔克先生
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark.

850
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,060
你觉得我没有吗
Do you think I'm not?

851
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,620
弗瑞为什么现在才找我们  而不是之前
Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?

852
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,510
他对我们隐瞒了什么
What isn't he telling us?

853
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,850
信息不全  我就无法解答
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

854
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,230
你是说弗瑞有什么没告诉我们吗
You think Fury's hiding something?

855
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,500
他是间谍  队长  他是间谍之王
He's a spy. Captain, he's "The" Spy.

856
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,980
他的秘密会下崽
His secrets have secrets.

857
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,950
你也在琢磨这事  对吧
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

858
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,570
我只想完成手头的工作...
I just want to finish my work here, and...

859
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,700
博士
Doctor?

860
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:37,480
为全人类点亮一盏明灯
"A warm light for all mankind."

861
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,730
关于魔方  洛基挖苦弗瑞的那句话
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

862
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:40,520
我也听到了
I heard it.

863
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,330
我认为他是在指你
I think that was meant for you.

864
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,100
即使巴顿没告诉洛基斯塔克大厦的事
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,

865
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,570
新闻上也到处都是了
it was still all over the news.

866
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,940
斯塔克大厦
The Stark Tower?

867
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,110
就是纽约那幢又大又丑...的大楼吗
That big, ugly building in New York?

868
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,250
为大楼供能的方舟反应堆是自给能源
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.

869
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,570
那栋大楼一年内都不需要外部能源吧
That building will run itself for, what, a year?

870
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:00,970
那还只是个原型
It's just the prototype.

871
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:03,900
我算是当今清洁能源界的唯一人
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

872
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,790
他就是这个意思
That's what he's getting at.

873
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,310
所以  神盾局为什么
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D.

874
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,170
不把他招进宇宙魔方计划
bring him in on the Tesseract project?

875
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,520
更何况  他们为什么要染指能源业
What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?

876
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,170
我应该调查一下
I should probably look into that

877
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,780
等我的解密程序破解了
once my decryption programme finishes

878
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,170
所有的神盾局加密文件
breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

879
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,920
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry. Did you say...

880
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,210
我一到舰桥  贾维斯就开始运行破解程序了
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

881
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:20,880
只要几个小时  我就能知道
In a few hours, I'll know

882
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,250
神盾局内部所有不可告人的秘密
every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

883
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:23,850
吃蓝莓吗
Blueberry?

884
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:26,260
你还想不通为什么神盾局不让你加入吗
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

885
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,150
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}intelligence有智力和情报两种意思

886
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,150
情报部门的人还惧怕天才吗
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?

887
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,940
可真是说不过去啊
Historically, not awesome.

888
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,370
我认为洛基是想让我们神经紧张
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

889
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,940
他可是要发动战争的人
This is a man who means to start a war

890
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,190
如果我们不能保持专注  他就得逞了
and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

891
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,770
我们接到命令  就要服从
We have orders. We should follow them.

892
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,430
服从命令不是我的风格
Following's not really my style.

893
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,860
你只在乎你的风格  是吧
And you're all about style, aren't you?

894
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,450
这个房间里的人
Of the people in this room,

895
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,390
是谁  首先穿得花里胡哨
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

896
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,010
其次  根本毫无用处
and, B, not of use?

897
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,440
史蒂夫  你真的不觉得这有点奇怪吗
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

898
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,390
找到魔方就是了
Just find the Cube.

899
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,360
他就是我爸一直念念不忘的家伙吗
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

900
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,330
他们是不是继续把他冻着比较好
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

901
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,730
关于洛基他说得对
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

902
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,610
他确实胜我们一筹
He does have the jump on us.

903
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,860
他不过是有个看着挺唬人的炸弹
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

904
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,430
早晚会把他自己炸飞
It's going to blow up in his face.

905
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,360
到时候我就等着看好戏
And I'm going to be there when it does.

906
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,080
那我还是等着看报纸好了
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

907
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,150
或者你会和我们一起披挂上阵
Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.

908
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,840
要知道  我可不穿盔甲
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

909
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,420
我就像神经一样暴露在外
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

910
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,730
简直是一场噩梦
It's a nightmare.

911
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,400
我身体里有一堆弹片
You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel

912
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,310
时刻都在往我心脏里爬
trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.

913
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,870
被这个挡住了
This stops it.

914
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,100
这个小小的光环  它已经是我的一部分了
This little circle of light, it's part of me now,

915
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,110
而不仅仅是盔甲
not just armour.

916
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,050
这是种可怕的特权
It's a terrible privilege.

917
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,870
-可你能控制它  -因为我找到了方法
- But you can control it. - Because I learned how.

918
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:04,870
我们不一样
It's different.

919
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:08,440
你的"意外事故"我都听说了
I read all about your accident.

920
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,080
你受了那么强的伽玛辐射  本该是死定了
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

921
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,180
所以你是说绿巨人...
So you're saying that the Hulk...

922
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,750
那个家伙救了我吗
The other guy saved my life?

923
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,870
不错
That's nice.

924
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:24,450
这么想挺好  可他为什么要救我
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

925
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,060
也许以后就知道了
I guess we'll find out.

926
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,390
那个答案你未必喜欢
You may not enjoy that.

927
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:32,530
但你也许会喜欢
And you just might.

928
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,900
{\an8}安全仓库

929
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:33,760
洛基带走了博士之后
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

930
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,370
我们转移了简·福斯特
we moved Jane Foster.

931
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,220
特罗瑟姆[挪威城市]有座很好的天文台
They've got an excellent observatory in Troms?

932
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,360
昨天突然有人请她去做顾问
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.

933
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,460
酬金不菲  搭乘私人飞机  地处偏远
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

934
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,640
她不会有事
She'll be safe.

935
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,730
谢谢
Thank you.

936
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,490
洛基带走艾瑞克·塞尔维格绝非偶然
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

937
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,100
等洛基达成目的  还不知会如何对他
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

938
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,990
艾瑞克是个好人
Erik is a good man.

939
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,490
他经常说起你
He talks about you a lot.

940
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,210
你改变了他的生活
You changed his life.

941
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,520
你还改变了这里的一切
You changed everything around here.

942
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,140
还是保持原样的好
They were better as they were.

943
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,260
在阿斯加德  我们自视高人一等
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced

944
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,230
却像俾施泰姆一样来这胡作非为
but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

945
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,200
-像什么  -俾施泰姆
- Like what? - Bilge snipe.

946
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,310
就是那种有鳞甲和大角的巨兽
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

947
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,070
-地球上没有吗  -应该没有
- You don't have those? - I don't think so.

948
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,640
那东西很可恶
Well, they are repulsive.

949
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,430
途经之地万物尽毁
And they trample everything in their path.

950
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,710
我第一次来地球时  引来了洛基的愤怒
When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,

951
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,590
人类为此遭受劫难
and your people paid the price.

952
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,260
现在历史又重演
And now, again.

953
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,470
年少无知的我渴望战争
In my youth, I courted war.

954
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:52,330
战争还没开始呢
War hasn't started yet.

955
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,060
你能从洛基口中问出宇宙魔方的下落吗
You think you could make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?

956
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:00,380
不知道  洛基的心思深不可测
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

957
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:04,470
他不仅渴望权力  还想要报复我
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.

958
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,840
任何痛苦都不能让他放弃自己的野心
There's no pain would prise his need from him.

959
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:10,340
很多人都曾这么认为
A lot of guys think that

960
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,930
直到他们尝到真正的痛苦
until the pain starts.

961
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,300
你要我做什么
What are you asking me to do?

962
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,970
我要问你  你愿意做什么
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

963
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,180
洛基现在是犯人
Loki is a prisoner.

964
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:21,950
但我为什么觉得
Then why do I feel like

965
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:25,430
他是唯一想待在这艘航母上的人
he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?

966
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,540
能偷偷接近我的人可不多
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.

967
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,650
可你猜到我会来
But you figured I'd come.

968
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,480
没这么早
After.

969
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,360
我以为弗瑞在用尽所有折磨后
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

970
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:52,890
才会派你来  假意友好  来安抚我
you would appear as a friend, as a balm.

971
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,800
我就会合作了
And I would cooperate.

972
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:58,160
我想知道你对巴顿特工做了什么
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

973
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,550
我开拓了他的心智
I would say I've expanded his mind.

974
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,060
等你赢了
And once you've won,

975
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,170
等你成了王
once you're king of the mountain,

976
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,800
他的心智会怎么样
what happens to his mind?

977
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,620
你爱他吗  罗曼诺夫特工
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

978
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:17,340
小孩子才说爱  我是欠他人情
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

979
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:22,010
说来听听
Tell me.

980
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,570
我进神盾局之前  我...
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...

981
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,380
我早已声名远扬
Well, I made a name for myself.

982
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:39,600
我有着独特的技能
I have a very specific skill set.

983
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:43,770
我不在乎为谁工作  或是对付谁
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

984
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,380
我上了神盾局的黑名单
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.

985
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,650
他们派巴顿特工来杀我
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

986
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,950
但他改了主意
He made a different call.

987
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,840
要是我保证放他一条生路  你要怎么回报我
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

988
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,100
我不会放了你
Not let you out.

989
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,410
我知道  可这多有趣
No, but I like this.

990
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:08,200
整个世界都危在旦夕  你却为一个人讨价还价
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.

991
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,180
政权的颠覆司空见惯
Regimes fall every day.

992
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,750
我不会纠结这个  我可是俄罗斯人
I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.

993
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,040
以前是
Or I was.

994
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,770
那你现在又算什么
And what are you now?

995
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:19,580
其实这事没这么复杂
It's really not that complicated.

996
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:24,230
我欠了债  我想要偿还
I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

997
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,610
你能吗
Can you?

998
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:31,560
那么多的债  你真的还得清吗
Can you wipe out that much red?

999
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,120
德雷科夫的女儿
Dreykov's daughter,

1000
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,710
圣保罗
St Paulo,

1001
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,130
医院的火灾
the hospital fire?

1002
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,600
巴顿把一切都告诉我了
Barton told me everything.

1003
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,480
你血债累累  沾满双手
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

1004
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,230
你以为救一个比你强不到哪去的人
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself

1005
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:52,690
能改变什么吗
will change anything?

1006
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,290
多廉价的多愁善感
This is the basest sentimentality.

1007
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,970
就像在祈祷的孩子
This is a child at prayer.

1008
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:59,450
可悲至极
Pathetic!

1009
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,120
你欺骗  杀戮
You lie and kill

1010
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,070
为骗子和杀手服务
in the service of liars and killers.

1011
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,440
{\an8}发现病毒  非法入侵

1012
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:12,210
你自以为清高  遵循自己的准则
You pretend to be separate, to have your own code,

1013
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,400
粉饰你所犯下的罪行
something that makes up for the horrors.

1014
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,490
但那是你的一部分
But they are part of you.

1015
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,700
永远无法抹去
And they will never go away.

1016
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:26,510
我会留着巴顿  我会让他杀了你
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.

1017
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,960
他深知你的恐惧
Slowly, intimately,

1018
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,350
他会一点一点亲手杀了你
in every way he knows you fear.

1019
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,680
之后我再唤醒他  给他时间欣赏自己的杰作
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work

1020
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,380
等他痛苦哀嚎的时候  我再要了他的命
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1021
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:41,010
这就是我还的价  你这没用的婊子
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

1022
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,090
你是个怪物
You're a monster.

1023
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,840
不
Oh, no.

1024
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,840
怪物是你带来的
You brought the monster.

1025
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,450
所以是班纳
So, Banner.

1026
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,460
那就是你的计划 
That's your play.

1027
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:58,860
什么
What?

1028
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,180
洛基想要让绿巨人变身
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1029
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,850
别让班纳出实验室  我马上就到
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1030
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,320
让托尔也过去
Send Thor as well.

1031
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,860
谢谢你的合作
Thank you for your cooperation.

1032
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,790
你在干什么  斯塔克先生
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1033
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,110
我也想问你同样的问题
Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

1034
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,040
你该去搜寻宇宙魔方的下落
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

1035
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,460
没错  搜索模型已经锁定
We are. The model's locked

1036
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,160
正在扫描搜索信号
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

1037
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,270
一有结果
When we get a hit,

1038
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,360
就能把范围缩小到半英里内
we'll have the location within half a mile.

1039
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,000
嗯  然后你就能拿回魔方  稍安毋躁
Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1040
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:35,250
二阶是什么
What is "Phase 2"?

1041
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,140
二阶是神盾局利用魔方制造武器
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the Cube to make weapons.

1042
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,010
抱歉  电脑对我来说太慢了
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

1043
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:44,850
罗杰斯  我们搜集所有与宇宙魔方有关的东西
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.

1044
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:45,620
这不代表我们...
This does not mean that we're making...

1045
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,060
不好意思  尼克
I'm sorry, Nick.

1046
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,710
你还有什么好说的吗
What were you lying?

1047
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,320
我错了  局长
I was wrong, Director.

1048
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,590
这个世界还是一点没变
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1049
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:53,700
这事你知道吗
Did you know about this?

1050
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,370
你要不要
You want to think about

1051
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,560
离开这里  博士
removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?

1052
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,790
我本在加尔各答[印]  离这远着呢
I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.

1053
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,170
洛基在操控你
Loki is manipulating you.

1054
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:01,600
那你一直以来做的又是什么
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1055
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,610
你肯来不是被我的魅力折服才来的
You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

1056
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,210
对  我也不会因为你突然神经质了就走
Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1057
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,150
我要知道神盾局为什么
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1058
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,540
利用宇宙魔方开发大规模杀伤性武器
is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

1059
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:13,600
因为他
Because of him.

1060
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,080
我
Me?

1061
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,220
去年   一个外星人来到地球
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet

1062
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,590
引发了一场恶战  结果移平了一座小镇
who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.

1063
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,010
我们不仅知道了宇宙中有其他生命存在
We learned that not only are we not alone

1064
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,700
还发现我们的战斗力远远不及他们
but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

1065
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,930
我的人民只想与地球和平相处
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

1066
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,950
可你们不是唯一的外星生命吧
But you're not the only people out there, are you?

1067
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,300
你们也不是唯一的威胁
And you're not the only threat.

1068
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,370
宇宙中充满了比我们强大的生物
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

1069
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,390
没有人能控制他们
that can't be controlled.

1070
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:41,570
就像你们控制不了魔方吗
Like you controlled the Cube?

1071
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:42,910
你们利用宇宙魔方制造武器
Your work with the Tesseract

1072
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,600
才会招来洛基和他的同伙
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1073
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,210
这是给其他种族发出的信号
It is a signal to all the realms

1074
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:50,090
宣告地球准备好展开高级战争
that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

1075
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:51,190
高级
A higher form?

1076
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,600
这是无奈之举
You forced our hand.

1077
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,230
我们必须有所准备
We had to come up with something.

1078
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,450
"核威慑"
A nuclear deterrent.

1079
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,730
因为那样总能平息所有事态
Because that always calms everything right down.

1080
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:59,270
别忘了你们家族的发家史  斯塔克
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

1081
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:01,330
如果斯塔克还在造军火  他肯定也脱不了...
I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...

1082
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:03,500
等等  矛头怎么指向我了
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1083
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,690
怎么  你不总是焦点吗
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1084
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:06,900
我以为人类要比这文明
I thought humans were more evolved than this.

1085
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,500
不好意思  人类跑去你的星球捣乱了吗
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?

1086
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,700
你居然这么不信任你们的守护者
You treat your champions with such mistrust.

1087
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,330
你们怎么这么幼稚
Are you boys really that naive?

1088
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:15,360
神盾局会监视所有潜在威胁
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1089
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,830
美国队长也是威胁吗
Captain America's on threat watch?

1090
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:17,750
我们都是
We all are.

1091
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,060
等等  你也上黑名单了吗
Wait, you're on that list?

1092
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,050
你和愤怒的蜜蜂[游戏]谁更靠前
Are you above or below angry bees?

1093
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,110
斯塔克  我发誓  你要是再说一句俏皮话...
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

1094
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:24,690
你这是口头恐吓  我感到威胁了
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1095
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:26,480
-放尊重点  -尊重什么
- Show some respect. - Respect what?

1096
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:37,820
66B号运输机  请说确认口令
Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.

1097
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:39,930
系统里有你的资料  但没有航行记录
I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.

1098
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,690
请上报运输货物  完毕
What is your haul? Over.

1099
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:44,300
武器弹药  完毕
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1100
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,630
你口口声声说要控制  却崇尚混乱
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

1101
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,960
这就是他的作风  不是吗
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1102
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,570
我们算是团队吗
I mean, what are we, a team?

1103
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:01,630
不  我们在一起只会产生混乱
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

1104
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,780
我们...就是个定时炸弹
We're a time bomb.

1105
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,760
你最好别插嘴
You need to step away.

1106
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,670
他为什么就不能发泄一下呢
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?

1107
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,720
这你清楚得很  少胡闹
You know damn well why. Back off!

1108
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,870
我倒想看看你有没有本事让我不闹
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1109
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:15,170
是吗  你只是穿着铁甲威风罢了
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1110
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,910
没有铁甲  你又算什么
Take that off, what are you?

1111
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,690
超级天才  亿万富翁  花心萝卜  慈善人士
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

1112
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,420
我认识很多人  即使没有这些也比你强上十倍
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

1113
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,500
我看过关于你的资料
I've seen the footage.

1114
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,870
你只在乎你自己
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

1115
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,910
你不会做出牺牲
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

1116
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,670
不会匍在铁丝网上让战友爬过去
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

1117
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:35,330
要是我就剪断铁丝网
I think I would just cut the wire.

1118
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:39,820
总是有歪门邪道
Always a way out.

1119
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,010
你也许不是威胁
You may not be a threat

1120
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,260
但你最好别再充英雄了
but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

1121
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,420
英雄  你那样的英雄吗
A hero? Like you?

1122
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,870
你就是个实验品  罗杰斯
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1123
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,950
你的一切超凡也不过是一瓶血清给的
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

1124
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,200
穿上铁甲  我们来战
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1125
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:25,430
你们人类真渺小
You people are so petty and tiny.

1126
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:26,320
这也叫团队
Yeah, this is a team.

1127
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,910
罗曼诺夫特工  请你护送
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1128
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:28,920
班纳博士回他的...
Dr Banner back to his...

1129
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,010
去哪  你把我的房间给别人了
Where? You rented my room.

1130
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,410
那个囚室只是以防...
The cell was just in case...

1131
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,970
以防你必须杀我
In case you needed to kill me.

1132
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:36,500
但你杀不了我  我知道  我自己试过
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1133
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,750
我很低落  看不到出路
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1134
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:46,390
所以我吞枪自杀  而那家伙把子弹吐了出来
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.

1135
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,950
所以我活了下去
So I moved on.

1136
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,150
专注于帮助别人  我本来很好
I focused on helping other people. I was good.

1137
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:54,730
直到你们把我拉来这场闹剧
Until you dragged me back into this freak show

1138
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,110
还危及所有人的安全
and put everyone here at risk.

1139
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:57,940
你不是想知道我有什么诀窍吗  罗曼诺夫特工
You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

1140
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,900
我怎么保持冷静的诀窍
You want to know how I stay calm?

1141
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,840
班纳博士
Dr Banner,

1142
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,010
放下权杖
put down the sceptre.

1143
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,600
{\an8}搜索中...

1144
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:12,800
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  94%

1145
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,470
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  95%

1146
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:16,860
找到了
Got it.

1147
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:18,790
抱歉  伙计们
Sorry, kids,

1148
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,930
你们没机会看我亮绝活了
you don't get to see my party trick after all.

1149
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:22,070
找到宇宙魔方了吗
You located the Tesseract?

1150
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,890
我能更快赶过去
I could get there fastest.

1151
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,270
宇宙魔方是阿斯加德的  人类无法控制
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.

1152
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:26,880
-你不能自己去  -你要阻止我吗
- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?

1153
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,900
等你穿上铁甲再说
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1154
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,410
打老年人我毫无压力
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1155
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:30,600
快穿上铁甲
Put on the suit.

1156
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:31,910
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  98%

1157
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:32,660
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  99%

1158
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,000
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  100%

1159
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,240
天啊
Oh, my God.

1160
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,370
去穿铁甲
Put on the suit.

1161
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,320
听你的
Yeah.

1162
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,180
全员就位
All hands to stations.

1163
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,200
-希尔  -航母外部发生爆炸
- Hill! - External detonation.

1164
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,790
-3号引擎停机  -我们遭到了袭击
- Number three engine is down. - We've been hit.

1165
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,640
-能修好吗  -3号引擎失火
- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!

1166
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,040
-什么情况  -涡轮机还算完好
- Talk to me. - Turbine looks mostly intact

1167
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,040
但我们在飞行状态下
but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs

1168
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,250
无法进入故障区维修
while we're in the air.

1169
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:15,780
再失去一个引擎我们就要坠毁了
If we lose one more engine we won't be.

1170
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,450
派人出去修理引擎
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.

1171
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,140
-斯塔克  听到了吗  -我这就去
- Stark, you copy that? - I'm on it.

1172
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:23,530
科尔森  启动关押区防御性封锁
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section,

1173
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:25,030
再去军械库
then get to the armoury.

1174
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,120
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff?

1175
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,430
我们没事
We're okay.

1176
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,610
没事的吧
We're okay, right?

1177
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,840
-别让引擎启动  -是  长官
- Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir.

1178
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,480
去关押区  先关闭摄像头
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1179
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,700
-是  -跟我来
- Got it. - Stay close.

1180
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,930
到第4层
Let's go, Level 4.

1181
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,520
3号引擎  那边见
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1182
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,480
博士
Doctor?

1183
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,050
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1184
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,460
你得挺住  不能正中洛基下怀
You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.

1185
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,980
我们不会有事的  听我说
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1186
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:20,260
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

1187
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:25,320
不会有事  好吗
We're going to be okay. All right?

1188
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,930
我用生命发誓  我一定会救你出去
I swear on my life I will get you out of this.

1189
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,680
你不会再被牵扯进来  再也不...
You will walk away and never ever...

1190
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,680
你的命
Your life?

1191
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:49,540
布鲁斯
Bruce.

1192
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:29,020
调转航母  航向180  向南行进
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1193
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,350
-把航母开向海面  -我们在盲目飞行
- Take us to the water! - We're flying blind.

1194
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,360
引擎故障后  导航系统重置了
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.

1195
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,190
天上有太阳吗
Is the sun coming up?

1196
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,500
-有  长官  -那就在太阳右边飞
- Yes, sir. - Then put it on the left.

1197
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,150
开往海面
Get us over water.

1198
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,530
再有涡轮熄火就要坠毁了
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.

1199
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,350
谢谢
Thanks.

1200
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,170
斯塔克
Stark!

1201
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,270
斯塔克  我来了
Stark, I'm here!

1202
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:55,810
很好
Good.

1203
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,640
看看是什么情况
Let's see what we've got.

1204
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,600
我得先修复超导冷却系统
I got to get this superconducting coolant system back online

1205
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,150
之后才能进入转轮
before I can access the rotors,

1206
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,940
清理残骸
work on dislodging the debris.

1207
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:10,050
你去引擎控制面板那里
I need you to get to that engine control panel

1208
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:12,370
告诉我哪些继电器过载了
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

1209
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,610
你看到了什么
What does it look like in there?

1210
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,790
电力设备
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

1211
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,630
嗯  你也没说错
Well, you're not wrong.

1212
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,390
我们不是敌人  班纳
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1213
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,220
快清醒过来
Try to think!

1214
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,400
好  继电器正常了
Okay, the relays are intact.

1215
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,170
接下来怎么做
What's our next move?

1216
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:55,270
就算我清理了残骸
Even if I clear the rotors,

1217
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,480
没有助力  转轮也无法重新启动
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

1218
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,180
我得进去推着它转
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

1219
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:01,140
转速上升了你就会被切碎
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.

1220
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,260
定子控制器
That stator control unit

1221
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,570
能翻转磁极
can reverse the polarity long enough

1222
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:04,900
直至磁悬浮解除  就能...
to disengage maglev and that could...

1223
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,290
说人话
Speak English!

1224
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:09,120
看到红色控制杆了吗
You see that red lever?

1225
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,180
它能让转轮减速  给我飞出来的时间
It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.

1226
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,330
待在那里  等我指令
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1227
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,710
撤离下层机库甲板上的全部人员
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

1228
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,850
小心手雷
Grenade!

1229
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:29,350
有人入侵
We've got a perimeter breach!

1230
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:31,240
敌人身着神盾局装备
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1231
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,770
全员注意
Call-outs at every junction.

1232
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:43,210
绿巨人和托尔在4层研发层
We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.

1233
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,780
2层和3层的摄像头被破坏
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1234
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,870
长官  绿巨人会把这里彻底毁掉
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1235
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,380
那就吸引他的注意力
Get his attention.

1236
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:53,250
60护航机前往Y型区  火力牵制敌人
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile.

1237
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,960
保持距离
Don't get too close.

1238
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,010
收到
Copy.

1239
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,430
锁定目标
Target acquired.

1240
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,270
开火
Target engaged.

1241
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,650
目标火了  他发火了
Target angry, target angry!

1242
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:39,450
你们不可能通过这道门  究竟想...
You're not getting through here, so what the hell...

1243
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,470
{\an8}1号引擎出现故障

1244
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,070
1号引擎停机了
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1245
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:10,030
我们正在失控下坠
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1246
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,460
长官  1号引擎彻底停转
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

1247
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,450
是巴顿  他毁了我们的系统
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

1248
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:16,330
他去关押层了
He's headed for the detention level.

1249
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,490
有人收到吗
Does anybody copy?

1250
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,740
我是罗曼诺夫特工
This is Agent Romanoff.

1251
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,590
我收到了
I copy.

1252
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,820
斯塔克  航母在下坠
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1253
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,260
嗯  发现了
Yeah, I noticed.

1254
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,270
不
No!

1255
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:11,160
你还能不能吸取教训了
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1256
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,420
人类认为我们是不死之身
The humans think us immortal.

1257
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,150
那就检验一下吧
Should we test that?

1258
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,240
请你退到一边去
Move away, please.

1259
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:08,740
你喜欢吗
You like this?

1260
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,390
你派来毁灭者后  我们研发了这个原型机
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.

1261
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:16,340
我都不清楚它的威力
Even I don't know what it does.

1262
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:18,990
你想试试看吗
Do you want to find out?

1263
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:22,640
不
No!

1264
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:33,120
塔莎
Tasha?

1265
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,430
你输定了
You're going to lose.

1266
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:09,940
是吗
Am I?

1267
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,800
因为你的本性
It's in your nature.

1268
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,820
你们那些英雄已经分崩离析
Your heroes are scattered.

1269
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,760
你们的飞行堡垒也将要坠落
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1270
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,100
我还有什么好担心的
Where is my disadvantage?

1271
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,420
你没有信念
You lack conviction.

1272
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,930
我觉得我...
I don't think I'm...

1273
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,010
威力不小嘛
So, that's what it does.

1274
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,010
{\an8}高度

1275
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,310
队长  扳控制杆
Cap, hit the lever.

1276
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,860
等我一下
I need a minute here!

1277
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:14,940
扳控制杆
Lever

1278
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:16,330
快点
now!

1279
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,290
救命
Help!

1280
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,100
对不起  头儿
Sorry, boss.

1281
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:07,980
被那神逃走了
The god rabbited.

1282
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,770
保持清醒
Just stay awake.

1283
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,630
看着我
Eyes on me.

1284
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,490
不行了  我得离岗了
No, I'm clocking out here.

1285
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:14,770
我不批准
Not an option.

1286
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,310
没关系  头儿
It's okay, boss.

1287
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,310
想要他们成为真正的团队
This was never gonna work

1288
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,640
就得给他们点...
if they didn't have something

1289
01:28:24,650 --> 01:28:25,570
动...
to...

1290
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,950
科尔森特工负伤了
Agent Coulson is down.

1291
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,320
医疗队赶过去了
A medical team is on its way to your location.

1292
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,370
他们已经到了
They're here.

1293
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:06,070
他们宣布死亡了
They called it.

1294
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,350
这是在菲尔·科尔森外套口袋里找到的
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1295
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:30,350
看来他没来得及找你要签名
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1296
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,400
我们现在完全停摆
We're dead in the air up here.

1297
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,220
通讯中断  魔方不知所踪
Our communications, the location of the Cube,

1298
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,030
班纳和托尔也下落不明
Banner, Thor...

1299
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,870
我已经山穷水尽了
I got nothing for you.

1300
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,680
还失去了最得力的属下
I lost my one good eye.

1301
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,840
也许这是我活该
Maybe I had that coming.

1302
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:58,580
没错
Yes,

1303
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:03,380
我们是想利用宇宙魔方制造武器
we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1304
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,900
但我并没有将所有希望放在这个上面
I never put all my chips on that number, though,

1305
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,480
因为我还有个更大胆的计划
because I was playing something even riskier.

1306
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:17,890
我有个设想  这事斯塔克知道
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1307
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,580
叫做"复仇者计划"
called the Avengers Initiative.

1308
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:28,850
是将一些能力超群的人聚集在一起
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people

1309
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,460
看他们组成的团队是不是更强大
to see if they could become something more.

1310
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:37,490
看他们是不是能在危急时刻并肩战斗
To see if they could work together when we needed them to,

1311
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:40,760
去打赢那些我们赢不了的战争
to fight the battles that we never could.

1312
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:48,910
菲尔·科尔森到死都相信这个设想
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.

1313
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:52,780
他相信英雄
In heroes.

1314
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,570
好吧
Well,

1315
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:06,200
这个观念是过时了
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1316
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:28,770
你从天上掉下来
You fell out of the sky.

1317
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,740
我伤着谁了吗
Did I hurt anybody?

1318
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:47,560
这附近也没人给你伤
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1319
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:50,980
不过你倒是把鸽子都吓坏了
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.

1320
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,560
那真走运
Lucky.

1321
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:55,530
或许是你瞄得准
Or just good aim.

1322
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:57,210
落下来的时候你还醒着呢
You were awake when you fell.

1323
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:01,020
-你都看见了吗  -都看到了
- You saw? - The whole thing.

1324
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,920
你穿透屋顶摔下来
Right through the ceiling.

1325
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,480
又大又绿还光着屁股
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1326
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,090
给
Here.

1327
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:10,670
本来没觉得你能穿上这个
Didn't think those would fit you

1328
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:13,680
直到你缩小到普通人的身材
until you shrunk down to a regular-size feller.

1329
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,590
谢谢
Thank you.

1330
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,250
你是外星人吗
Are you an alien?

1331
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:21,650
什么
What?

1332
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,930
你是外太空来的人吗
From outer space, an alien.

1333
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:25,210
不是
No.

1334
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,880
这样啊  那你可病得不轻啊  孩子
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1335
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:42,200
克林特  你不会有事的
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1336
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:46,300
是吗
You know that?

1337
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:49,470
你确定吗
Is that what you know?

1338
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:55,260
我不能松懈
I've got no window.

1339
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:57,760
我得把他赶出去
I have to flush him out.

1340
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,400
你得稳定下来  这需要时间
You got to level out. It's going to take time.

1341
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,830
你不明白
You don't understand.

1342
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:06,820
你知道被人夺去意志  肆意摆布的滋味吗
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

1343
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:11,400
把你的意识排除在外  塞进另一个自己
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

1344
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:17,220
你知道那种被摧毁的感觉吗
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

1345
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,560
你知道我明白那种感觉
You know that I do.

1346
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,600
我怎么恢复的
Why am I back?

1347
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:32,460
你怎么把他弄走的
How did you get him out?

1348
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,850
我重校准了你的意识
Cognitive recalibration.

1349
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,480
就是狠狠地砸了你的脑袋
I hit you really hard on the head.

1350
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:39,970
谢谢
Thanks.

1351
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,020
娜塔莎
Natasha...

1352
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:47,510
我杀了多少特...
How many agents did I...

1353
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:48,410
别
Don't.

1354
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:51,290
别这么折磨自己  克林特
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1355
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,110
错的是洛基
This is Loki.

1356
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:56,440
是怪物和魔法
This is monsters and magic,

1357
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,570
是我们从未对付过的敌人
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1358
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,280
洛基  他跑了吗
Loki, did he get away?

1359
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,200
是的
Yeah.

1360
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,990
你知道他去哪里了吗
I don't suppose you know where.

1361
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:04,940
这我不需要知道
I didn't need to know.

1362
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:06,700
我没问
I didn't ask.

1363
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:12,740
不过他很快就会行动
He's going to make his play soon, though.

1364
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:14,800
就在今天
Today.

1365
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,050
我们得阻止他
We got to stop him.

1366
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:17,880
是吗  我们都有谁
Yeah? Who's "We"?

1367
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,040
不知道  还剩下的人吧
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1368
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:22,020
嗯
Well,

1369
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,300
要是我能一箭射穿洛基的眼窝
if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,

1370
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:28,660
应该就能睡个好觉了
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1371
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,500
这话才像你
Now you sound like you.

1372
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,400
可你不像你
But you don't.

1373
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,330
你是间谍  不是战士
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1374
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,100
现在你却要去冲锋陷阵  为什么
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1375
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:48,650
洛基把你怎么了
What did Loki do to you?

1376
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:51,740
没怎么  我只是...
He didn't. I just...

1377
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,110
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1378
01:34:59,710 --> 01:35:01,570
我被他动摇了
I've been compromised.

1379
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,680
我欠了债
I got red in my ledger.

1380
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:10,590
我想要还债
I would like to wipe it out.

1381
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:28,240
他结婚了吗
Was he married?

1382
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:29,770
没有
No.

1383
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:35,120
有个女友  好像是大提琴手
There was a cellist, I think.

1384
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,190
真可惜
I'm sorry.

1385
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:39,740
他看着人不错
He seemed like a good man.

1386
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,390
他就是个笨蛋
He was an idiot.

1387
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:44,510
为什么  因为他有信仰吗
Why? For believing?

1388
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,090
因为他单独去对付洛基
For taking on Loki alone.

1389
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,890
那叫尽职尽责
He was doing his job.

1390
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,000
那叫自不量力  他该等待支援
He was out of his league. He should have waited.

1391
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,070
他该...
He should have...

1392
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:53,850
有时候没有别的选择  托尼
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1393
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,790
是啊  这话真耳熟
Right, I've heard that before.

1394
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:57,700
这是你第一次失去战友吗
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1395
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,460
我们不是战士
We are not soldiers.

1396
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:05,730
我不会听令于弗瑞
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1397
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:06,980
我也不会
Neither am I.

1398
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:09,340
他也该为洛基犯下的罪行负责
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.

1399
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:10,890
但现在我们必须既往不咎
But right now, we got to put that behind us

1400
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,470
共同对付外敌
and get this done.

1401
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,700
洛基需要一个能量源
Loki needs a power source.

1402
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,320
要是我们能列出...
If we can put together a list...

1403
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,420
他把战争变成了私仇
He made it personal.

1404
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,740
那不是重点
That's not the point.

1405
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,280
这就是重点  这就是洛基的目的
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1406
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,450
他为什么要直捣我们的老巢
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1407
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,160
为了击溃我们
To tear us apart.

1408
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:25,290
是啊  分散击破的确很聪明
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1409
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:27,980
但他知道他必须要铲除我们
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

1410
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,440
这才是他的目的
That's what he wants.

1411
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:32,100
他要打败我们  还要别人看到
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.

1412
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,670
他想要观众
He wants an audience.

1413
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,790
对  我在斯图加特就碰上他的表演
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1414
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,510
没错  那只是试映
Yeah, that was just previews.

1415
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:39,080
这可是首演之夜
This is opening night.

1416
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,550
而洛基就是这场华丽闹剧的主角
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1417
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:43,440
他渴望鲜花和掌声
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1418
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,700
他要一座高耸入云的纪念碑  上面刻着他的名字
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...

1419
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:49,960
我靠
Son of a bitch.

1420
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:59,370
{\an8}斯塔克

1421
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:02,790
该走了
Time to go.

1422
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,640
-去哪里  -路上说
- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.

1423
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,050
你会开飞机吗
Can you fly one of those jets?

1424
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:08,140
我会
I can.

1425
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,600
你有战斗服吗
You got a suit?

1426
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:14,610
有
Yeah.

1427
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:15,680
那就换装
Then suit up.

1428
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,340
未经允许你们不能登机
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.

1429
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:47,570
孩子  别说了
Son, just don't.

1430
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:50,560
长官
Sir.

1431
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:51,810
希尔特工
Agent Hill.

1432
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:53,690
那些卡片
Those cards,

1433
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:59,620
是放在科尔森的衣柜里  而不是外套
they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.

1434
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:06,330
他们需要点动力
They needed the push.

1435
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:12,470
6号停机坪有人私自起飞
We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.

1436
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,000
他们找到洛基了
They found him.

1437
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:17,730
想尽一切办法恢复通讯
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.

1438
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:20,950
-我要监控全局  -是  长官
- I want eyes on everything. - Yes, sir.

1439
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:36,630
先生  我关闭了方舟反应堆
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1440
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:40,050
但那个装置已经自续供能了
but the device is already self-sustaining.

1441
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,310
关掉它  塞尔维格博士
Shut it down, Dr Selvig.

1442
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:44,560
太迟了
It's too late!

1443
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:48,030
她停不下来了
She can't stop now.

1444
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,950
她有东西要给我们看
She wants to show us something!

1445
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,270
一个新宇宙
A new universe.

1446
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:54,860
好吧
Okay.

1447
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:04,430
那层屏障是纯能量
The barrier is pure energy.

1448
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:06,300
无法打破
It's unbreachable.

1449
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:07,560
看出来了
Yeah, I got that.

1450
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,410
更换计划
Plan B.

1451
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:13,790
先生  马克7型还不能使用
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

1452
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:15,890
那就不要轮子了  我们没时间了
Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.

1453
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,710
你是来求我开恩的吧
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.

1454
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:41,800
其实我是来威胁你的
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1455
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,150
那你可不该把铁甲脱了
You should have left your armour on for that.

1456
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,040
是啊
Yeah.

1457
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:46,640
那一身穿得有些旧了
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1458
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,780
你还拿着金闪闪的命运之杖呢
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

1459
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:51,330
来一杯吗
Would you like a drink?

1460
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,900
拖时间也没有用
Stalling me won't change anything.

1461
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:55,210
不不不  是威胁
No, no. Threatening.

1462
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,460
你真的不喝吗
No drink? Are you sure?

1463
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:58,850
我可要来一杯
I'm having one.

1464
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:04,060
齐塔瑞大军要来了  谁都无法阻止
The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.

1465
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,430
我还怕什么
What have I to fear?

1466
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,710
复仇者联盟
The Avengers.

1467
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,860
是我们自己起的名字  就是一队人
That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.

1468
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,650
地球最强英雄组合什么的
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1469
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,760
我见识过了
Yes, I've met them.

1470
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:17,870
好吧
Yeah.

1471
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,230
我承认磨合是要花些时间
It takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.

1472
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:22,460
不过我们还是来列一下吧
But let's do a head count, here.

1473
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:24,690
我们有你的半神哥哥
Your brother, the demigod,

1474
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,030
一个超级战士
a super soldier,

1475
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:30,670
不负盛名的不死传奇
a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.

1476
01:40:30,670 --> 01:40:33,880
一个有着严重愤怒管理问题的家伙
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,

1477
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:37,120
一对顶级杀手  而你  好家伙
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,

1478
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,390
你把他们所有人都惹毛了
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

1479
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:41,770
这就是我的计划
That was the plan.

1480
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:42,920
不怎么明智
Not a great plan.

1481
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,120
等他们来了
When they come,

1482
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,050
他们肯定会来
and they will,

1483
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:48,720
他们会让你付出代价
they'll come for you.

1484
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:50,060
我有一支大军
I have an army.

1485
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:51,260
我们有绿巨人
We have a Hulk.

1486
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,280
那头野兽不是跑丢了吗
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1487
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,300
你搞错了重点  不会有王位的
You're missing the point. There is no throne.

1488
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:58,660
你是绝不可能获胜的
There is no version of this where you come out on top.

1489
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:01,770
或许你有军队要来  或许我们抵挡不了
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,

1490
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:03,250
但一切都会算在你头上
but it's all on you.

1491
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:05,720
因为如果我们保护不了地球
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1492
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,850
你就等着我们来复仇吧
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

1493
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,050
要是他们忙着对付你
How will your friends have time for me

1494
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,290
哪还有时间来战我
when they are so busy fighting you?

1495
01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:24,620
以前都可以的
This usually works.

1496
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:27,680
性能失常什么的也算常见了
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.

1497
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,840
五个男人就有一个...
One out of five...

1498
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,350
贾维斯  可以了
Jarvis, anytime now.

1499
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,420
你们都会败在我脚下
You will all fall before me.

1500
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:39,690
启动
Deploy!

1501
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:41,530
快启动
Deploy!

1502
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:11,260
你还惹毛了一个人
And there's one other person you pissed off.

1503
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,000
他的名字叫菲尔
His name was Phil.

1504
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,770
好吧
Right.

1505
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:40,390
大军来了
Army.

1506
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:53,950
洛基
Loki!

1507
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,450
关掉宇宙魔方  不然我就毁了它
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1508
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:57,470
你毁不掉
You can't.

1509
01:43:57,630 --> 01:43:59,220
你无法阻止了
There is no stopping it.

1510
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:00,780
现在只有
There is only

1511
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,600
战争
the war.

1512
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,940
那就来吧
So be it.

1513
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:28,290
斯塔克  我们在你3点钟方向  航向东北
Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.

1514
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:29,960
什么  你们去买外卖了吗
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1515
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,360
去帕克大街  我引他们过去给你们当靶子
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.

1516
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,640
先生  有更多敌人
Sir, we have more incoming.

1517
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:53,540
好吧  我们去会会他们
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1518
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:02,180
-小娜  -我看见他了
- Nat? - I see him.

1519
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:47,860
我们得到上面去
We got to get back up there.

1520
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,410
斯塔克  你看见这东西了吗
Stark, are you seeing this?

1521
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:44,800
看见了  但还在消化中
Seeing. Still working on believing.

1522
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,370
班纳出现了吗
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

1523
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:47,270
班纳
Banner?

1524
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,920
他到了就告诉我
Just keep me posted.

1525
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:50,900
贾维斯  找出它的弱点
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1526
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,160
你自己看看
Look at this!

1527
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,280
看看这一切
Look around you!

1528
01:46:57,910 --> 01:47:00,720
你以为你称了王  疯狂会就此结束吗
You think this madness will end with your rule?

1529
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:02,920
太迟了
It's too late.

1530
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:06,210
想阻止也来不及了
It's too late to stop it.

1531
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:09,540
不  只要我们一起就可以
No. We can, together.

1532
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:17,900
太天真了
Sentiment.

1533
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,550
有平民被困在里面了
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1534
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:50,960
洛基
Loki.

1535
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:03,970
他们在下面只有挨打的份
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1536
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,760
这边有我们  没问题  你去吧
We got this. It's good. Go.

1537
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:13,400
你能挡住他们吗
Do you think you can hold them off?

1538
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:14,630
队长
Captain,

1539
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:18,040
我非常乐意
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1540
01:48:46,150 --> 01:48:48,370
这让我想到了布达佩斯那次
Just like Budapest all over again.

1541
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:50,970
我们对布达佩斯的回忆太不同了
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1542
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:09,730
集结国民警卫队需要一小时
It's going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard.

1543
01:49:09,730 --> 01:49:10,760
国民警卫队
National Guard?

1544
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,390
军队知道这里发生了什么吗
Does the army know what's happening here?

1545
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:15,730
我们知道吗
Do we?

1546
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:17,860
派人到这些大楼里去
You need men in these buildings.

1547
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:19,160
楼里的人逃跑的时候
There are people inside and they're going to be running

1548
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:20,630
会被火力波及到
right into the line of fire.

1549
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,800
要带他们走地下室或是地铁
You take them to the basements or through the subway.

1550
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,520
别让他们到街上来
You keep them off the streets.

1551
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:27,230
封锁这里到39大街
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1552
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:29,360
我凭什么听你指挥
Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1553
01:49:42,890 --> 01:49:44,280
派人到这些大楼里去
I need men in those buildings.

1554
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:46,490
把人往地下带  别到街上来
Lead the people down and away from the streets.

1555
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:49,480
封锁这里到39大街
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.

1556
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:01,410
好吧  它盯上我们了
Well, we got its attention.

1557
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:02,690
接下去怎么办
What the hell was step two?

1558
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:33,770
上面怎么样了
What's the story upstairs?

1559
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:35,840
包围魔方的能量无法穿透
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.

1560
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,020
托尔说得对  我们得先对付这些怪物
Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.

1561
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:40,180
-怎么对付  -齐心协力
- How do we do this? - As a team.

1562
01:50:40,190 --> 01:50:42,150
我和洛基还有帐要算
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1563
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:43,400
是吗  排个号吧
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1564
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:44,340
把力气省下来
Save it.

1565
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:45,910
洛基会集中兵力对付我们
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,

1566
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:46,940
而我们正要他这样
and that's what we need.

1567
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,750
没有他的控制  它们会群魔无首
Without him, these things could run wild.

1568
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:51,300
斯塔克在上面  他会需要我们...
We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...

1569
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:02,810
那个  看起来真恐怖
So, this all seems horrible.

1570
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:04,760
我见过更恐怖的
I've seen worse.

1571
01:51:05,210 --> 01:51:06,080
抱歉
Sorry.

1572
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,150
没关系  我们或许需要一点恐怖
No, we could use a little worse.

1573
01:51:09,150 --> 01:51:11,710
-斯塔克  他来了  -班纳吗
- Stark, we got him. - Banner?

1574
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,890
被你说中了
Just like you said.

1575
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:16,220
让他武装起来  我这就把好戏拉过去
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1576
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,290
我不觉得这是什么好戏
I don't see how that's a party.

1577
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:33,220
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

1578
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:36,950
现在你最好生气起来了
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

1579
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:39,140
这就是我的诀窍  队长
That's my secret, Captain.

1580
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:43,050
我一直在生气
I'm always angry.

1581
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:55,650
撑住
Hold on!

1582
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:27,560
都派出来
Send the rest.

1583
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:35,260
快看
Guys.

1584
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,990
下命令吧  队长
Call it, Captain.

1585
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:38,260
好  都听好了
All right, listen up.

1586
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,910
在关掉传送门之前  想办法控制局面
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.

1587
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,600
巴顿  我要你到那个屋顶上去
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1588
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:44,640
观察战场  报告敌军的动向
Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.

1589
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,130
斯塔克  你守住封锁线
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1590
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:47,450
不要让这些怪物跑出三个街区
Anything gets more than three blocks out,

1591
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:49,140
挡不回去的直接轰成渣
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1592
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:50,440
-送我一程好吗  -好
- Can you give me a lift? - Right.

1593
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,890
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《魔戒》里擅长弓箭的精灵

1594
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,890
抓紧了  莱戈拉斯
Better clench up, Legolas.

1595
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:57,850
托尔  你得想办法堵上传送门
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.

1596
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:58,900
拖慢它们的速度
Slow them down.

1597
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:01,440
你召唤闪电  劈死这群怪物
You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.

1598
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:05,070
你和我  我们守住地面
You and me, we stay here on the ground.

1599
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:06,330
牵制兵力
We keep the fighting here.

1600
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:07,500
绿巨人
And Hulk...

1601
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:11,170
使劲砸
Smash.

1602
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:05,670
长官
Sir.

1603
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,110
理事会在线上了
The Council is on.

1604
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:15,990
斯塔克  你后面跟了不少飞虫
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

1605
01:54:17,730 --> 01:54:19,990
我是不想让它们到街上去
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.

1606
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:21,680
他们拐起弯来差劲得很
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1607
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:23,610
找个死角
So find a tight corner.

1608
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:25,290
收到
I will roger that.

1609
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,610
真烦人
Oh, boy.

1610
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:57,380
指挥得好
Nice call.

1611
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,130
还有什么
What else you got?

1612
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:01,570
托尔在6大街跟一支飞行队干起来了
Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.

1613
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:04,210
他居然不带我玩
And he didn't invite me.

1614
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,610
队长  如果不关上传送门
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing

1615
01:55:45,610 --> 01:55:47,070
我们怎么打都是徒劳
if we don't close that portal.

1616
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:48,590
最强的武器都穿不透它
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1617
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:50,180
也许是选的武器不对
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1618
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:55,070
你上去得搭个便车
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.

1619
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:57,220
我有车搭
I got a ride.

1620
01:55:58,300 --> 01:55:59,780
不过你得推我一把
I could use a boost, though.

1621
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,260
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

1622
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:05,410
嗯  肯定很有趣
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1623
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:34,580
转弯  快转弯
Okay, turn, turn.

1624
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:36,240
收住  收住
Less! Less!

1625
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:02,160
队长  过麦迪逊大街的42街银行
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

1626
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:04,180
有很多平民被敌人困在里面
They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.

1627
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:05,210
我这就去
I'm on it.

1628
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:27,620
大家让开
Everyone! Clear out!

1629
01:58:58,060 --> 01:58:59,430
弗瑞局长
Director Fury,

1630
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:01,460
理事会已经做出决定
the Council has made a decision.

1631
01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:04,570
这我知道了
I recognise the Council has made a decision.

1632
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:06,520
但鉴于这个决定蠢到家了
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1633
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:07,860
我决定无视
I have elected to ignore it.

1634
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:11,340
局长  你们比我们的潜艇离得都近
Director, you're closer than any of our subs.

1635
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,520
立刻派出战机
You scramble that jet...

1636
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,530
那可是曼哈顿岛  理事
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

1637
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:17,520
除非我的队伍确实撑不住了
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1638
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:21,300
不然我不会下令对平民实施核打击
I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.

1639
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:23,730
如果不在这里挡住他们  那就无法挽回了
If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.

1640
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:26,100
如果投了核弹  那才真叫无法挽回
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1641
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:31,620
是你啊
You.

1642
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:35,150
鹰眼
Hawkeye!

1643
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:37,940
小娜  你干什么呢
Nat, what are you doing?

1644
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,860
帮下忙
A little help?

1645
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:46,390
放着我来
I got him.

1646
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:13,860
够了
Enough!

1647
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:16,280
你们都算什么东西
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1648
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:19,070
我可是神  你这蠢货
I am a god, you dull creature.

1649
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,310
你休想欺辱我  你这...
And I will not be bullied by...

1650
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:32,000
弱爆了的神
Puny god.

1651
02:00:40,830 --> 02:00:41,950
权杖
The sceptre...

1652
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:44,340
博士
Doctor.

1653
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:49,170
洛基的权杖  它的能量
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1654
02:00:49,470 --> 02:00:51,180
宇宙魔方无人能敌
The Tesseract can't fight,

1655
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:53,410
但它抵挡不了来自身的攻击
but you can't protect against yourself.

1656
02:00:53,410 --> 02:00:54,090
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1657
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:55,650
你不知道自己在做什么
You didn't know what you were doing.

1658
02:00:58,810 --> 02:01:00,280
事实上  我知道
Actually, I think I did.

1659
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,840
我装了一个可以切断能量源的保险装置
I built in a safety to cut their power source.

1660
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:06,550
洛基的权杖
Loki's sceptre.

1661
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:08,950
或许能关闭传送门
It may be able to close the portal.

1662
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:13,410
它就在那里
And I'm looking right at it.

1663
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:28,800
先生  我们剩下的能量不足以穿透它的外壳
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.

1664
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:39,560
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《圣经》中的故事  约拿被大鱼吞下肚

1665
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:39,560
贾维斯  你听过约拿的故事吗
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1666
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,130
我不建议你学他
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1667
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,490
弗瑞局长已被解除指挥权
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1668
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:55,730
代行命令  7A11
Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.

1669
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:58,480
7A11命令确认  可以起飞
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.

1670
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:01,390
长官  有架战机起飞了
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1671
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,760
甲板人员注意  有架战机擅自起飞
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.

1672
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:05,070
必须马上阻止
We need to shut it down!

1673
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:07,620
重复  起飞未经许可
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1674
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,680
斯塔克  你听见了吗
Stark, do you hear me?

1675
02:03:40,250 --> 02:03:42,690
有一枚导弹朝曼哈顿去了
You have a missile headed straight for the city.

1676
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:43,760
还有多久
How long?

1677
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:46,240
最多三分钟
Three minutes, max.

1678
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:48,400
它的核弹能将市中心夷为平地
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1679
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:50,480
贾维斯  将余下动力全部输至推进器
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.

1680
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:51,490
输完了
I just did.

1681
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:06,390
核弹已发射
Package is sent.

1682
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:09,880
爆炸倒计时  2分30秒
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1683
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,040
准备好再战一轮了吗
Are you ready for another bout?

1684
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:37,050
怎么  你犯困了吗
What, are you getting sleepy?

1685
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:43,410
对准顶部
Right at the crown!

1686
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:51,190
我能关掉它
I can close it.

1687
02:04:51,910 --> 02:04:53,060
你们听见了吗
Can anybody copy?

1688
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:55,530
我能关掉传送门
I can shut the portal down.

1689
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:57,430
-快关  -别关  等等
- Do it! - No, wait.

1690
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:58,800
斯塔克  敌人还在不断涌进来
Stark, these things are still coming.

1691
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,600
有枚核弹飞过来了
I got a nuke coming in.

1692
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,400
一分钟内就会爆炸
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1693
02:05:11,710 --> 02:05:13,660
而我刚好知道该把它送去哪
And I know just where to put it.

1694
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:23,090
斯塔克  你的能量不够回来了
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1695
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:24,460
留着能量转弯吧  老贾
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1696
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:27,640
先生  要我联系波茨小姐吗
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1697
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,800
好的
Might as well.

1698
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:35,320
纽约街道沦为战场
The streets of New York City have become a battleground.

1699
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:38,010
{\an8}曼哈顿市中心遭袭

1700
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:37,730
军队已到现场对抗敌人
The Army is here trying to contain the violence

1701
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:40,000
但显然力不从心
but clearly, it is outmatched.

1702
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,420
我得承认  我干这行这么多年
And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,

1703
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:44,400
这样的事是闻所未闻
I have never seen anything like this.

1704
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:46,860
我们对这支队伍知之甚少
We have limited information on the team

1705
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:50,810
但我们知道亿万富翁托尼·斯塔克  即钢铁侠
but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1706
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:28,790
先生  波茨小姐...
Sir, Miss Potts...

1707
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:28,640
{\an8}呼叫失败

1708
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:05,390
快点  斯塔克
Come on, Stark.

1709
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:13,320
关上吧
Close it.

1710
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:34,840
真有你的
Son of a gun.

1711
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:40,740
他没有减速
He's not slowing down.

1712
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,250
他还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

1713
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:29,550
我去
What the hell?

1714
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:33,630
怎么回事
What just happened?

1715
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,050
刚刚没人亲我吧
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1716
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:42,230
我们赢了
We won.

1717
02:08:45,210 --> 02:08:46,550
太好了
All right, yay!

1718
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:48,390
万岁  干得好  伙计们
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1719
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:52,160
明天别上班了  给自己放假一天
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.

1720
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:54,520
你们吃过土耳其烤肉吗
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1721
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:57,330
离这两条街外有家土耳其烤肉店
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.

1722
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:59,290
其实我没吃过  但我想尝尝
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

1723
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:00,770
还没结束呢
We're not finished yet.

1724
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:07,340
那就回头再去
And then shawarma after.

1725
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:31,100
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you,

1726
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:36,580
我现在想来一杯
I'll have that drink now.

1727
02:09:44,690 --> 02:09:45,930
尽管城市饱受摧残
Despite the devastation

1728
02:09:45,930 --> 02:09:48,590
在这起已证实为外星入侵的袭击事件中
of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack,

1729
02:09:48,590 --> 02:09:52,410
这支名为复仇者联盟小队的英雄壮举
the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the Avengers

1730
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:54,290
对很多人来说不仅是安慰  更值得庆祝
has been to many a cause not only for comfort, but for celebration.

1731
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:56,820
知道他们的存在真是太好了
It's just really great knowing they're out there.

1732
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:59,360
有人在守护着我们
That someone is watching over us.

1733
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:00,890
我爱你  托尔
I love you, Thor!

1734
02:10:00,890 --> 02:10:02,350
这些家伙就...
And then these guys were like...

1735
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:04,000
到处都在爆炸
And then the air goes...

1736
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:05,890
然后那个绿色的家伙就...
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

1737
02:10:05,890 --> 02:10:06,840
说不清
I don't know.

1738
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:09,340
这些家伙的存在让我觉得不安全
I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.

1739
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:12,350
我就是有种被蒙在鼓里的感觉
It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.

1740
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:16,290
纽约有超级英雄  少来了
Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.

1741
02:10:16,290 --> 02:10:18,250
这些所谓的英雄
These so-called "Heroes"

1742
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:19,830
{\an8}谢谢你们  复仇者联盟

1743
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:21,620
必须为城市的损毁负责
have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city.

1744
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:24,270
他们打完了仗  都跑哪去了
This was their fight. Where are they now?

1745
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:27,330
人们对复仇者联盟充满好奇
Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.

1746
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:29,920
但他们就像当时突然出现一样地突然消失了
Their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance...

1747
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:32,280
怎么  这事反倒怪在他们头上吗
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1748
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:37,410
美国队长是我的救命恩人
Captain America saved my life.

1749
02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:43,500
不管他在哪里  不管他们都身处何方
Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,

1750
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,690
我只想
I would just...

1751
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:47,800
我只想说声谢谢
I would want to say thank you.

1752
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:52,340
复仇者们都去哪了
Where are the Avengers?

1753
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:54,740
我暂时没有追查他们的行踪
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1754
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:57,160
在我看来他们有权休假
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1755
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:58,480
宇宙魔方呢
And the Tesseract?

1756
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:01,500
魔方已经回到了它该去的地方
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1757
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:03,490
远离我们
Out of our reach.

1758
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:05,580
你无权做这种决定
That's not your call.

1759
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:06,930
决定不是我做的
I didn't make it.

1760
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:09,300
做这个决定的是神  我没有争辩
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1761
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:11,200
你就这么让他带走了魔方
So, you let him take it

1762
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:14,650
还有该为他的罪行受到制裁的战犯洛基
and the war criminal, Loki, who should be answering for his crime.

1763
02:11:14,650 --> 02:11:17,110
我想他会受到制裁的
I think he will be.

1764
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:33,740
我看你没意识到你这么做的后果
I don't think you understand what you've started,

1765
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:35,940
就这么让复仇者们回到社会上
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

1766
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:37,830
他们都是危险人物
They're dangerous.

1767
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:41,370
确实  他们的威名不仅传遍天下
They surely are, and the whole world knows it.

1768
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:44,390
更声振寰宇
Every world knows it.

1769
02:11:44,910 --> 02:11:46,760
这不正是我们的目的吗
Was that the point of all this?

1770
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,380
一个宣言
A statement?

1771
02:11:51,550 --> 02:11:52,550
一个保证
A promise.

1772
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,530
长官  之后要怎么办
Sir, how does it work now?

1773
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,020
他们都各走各的了
They've gone their separate ways.

1774
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:08,960
有的人还去了很远的地方
Some, pretty extremely far.

1775
02:12:10,290 --> 02:12:12,230
再遇到这种情况
If we get into a situation like this again,

1776
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:13,550
我们该怎么办
what happens then?

1777
02:12:13,990 --> 02:12:15,220
他们还会回来
They'll come back.

1778
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:17,720
你真的确定吗
Are you really sure about that?

1779
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:19,350
是的
I am.

1780
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:21,840
为什么
Why?

1781
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:25,050
因为我们需要他们回来
Because we'll need them to.

1782
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:20,050
人类
Humans.

1783
02:15:20,730 --> 02:15:25,150
并不像他说的那样懦弱卑微
They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.

1784
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:28,100
他们坚守家园
They stand.

1785
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:34,530
难以驾驭  不能被统治
They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled.

1786
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:44,900
与他们为敌
To challenge them

1787
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:49,660
无异于求死
is to court death.
